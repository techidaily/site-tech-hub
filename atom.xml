The discount is no <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-live-2024-07-15/" >Prime Day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> doorbuster, but take it from me: You’ll want to buy a pair of these in-ear headphones even if you already own wireless earbuds or aren’t an Apple user. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-amazon-prime-day-deals/"><strong>The best Prime Day deals right now</strong></a></p><p>In fact, I just returned home from a work trip to Paris, and I can’t even count the number of times the USB-C EarPods helped me stay productive, entertained, and connected with family and friends during my downtime. Here’s how else it shines for the price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-EarPods-Headphones-Built-Control/dp/B0CHXC5ZDX?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd1727d25-62fd-44c1-aba8-20b881a32385%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Apple EarPods with USB-C View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For one, wired earbuds don’t need to be charged; you just plug them into a phone, laptop, or tablet, and you’re all set for your audio needs. This latest model that Apple is selling just so happens to have a USB-C plug, meaning it’ll work with just about any modern piece of technology, including the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >latest iPhones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-accessories/" >The best iPhone accessories of 2024: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Secondly, the microphone quality on Apple’s wired EarPods is some of the best I’ve heard. For video meetings, phone calls, and even voice recording, the EarPods’ microphone is on par with lavaliers that cost significantly more. I’ve used these to record several video scripts for ZDNET’s social media channels, and it blows my mind every time I hear how crisp the audio comes out.</p><p>It should come as no surprise that I quickly bought another pair of USB-C <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-EarPods-Headphones-Built-Control/dp/B0CHXC5ZDX?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd1727d25-62fd-44c1-aba8-20b881a32385%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Apple EarPods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when they finally went on sale this morning.

We saw design changes, hardware updates, the implementation of Apple Intelligence, and more. The presentation was packed with reveals; both big and small. So to make things easy for you, we’re highlighting four of the best features for the iPhone 16 line.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Apple-Intelligence"><a href="#1-Apple-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="1. Apple Intelligence"></a>1. Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Screenshot by Kayla Solino&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Siri has finally received its long-awaited update, becoming “smarter” than ever before. The AI assistant has a richer understanding of language thanks to Apple Intelligence. Siri can now maintain context even when a user makes multiple requests. Plus it can continue following along even if you stumble over your words. If you have any burning questions about any Apple products, the AI has more extensive product knowledge to help you shop.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The updates don’t stop there. Apple Intelligence enables so much more. They include but are not limited to, Writing Tools to help you edit text, call recordings for the Phone app, notification summaries, and Private Cloud Compute for enhancing the device’s processing power. </p><p>Apple Intelligence will not be available at launch. It’ll roll out in October as a software upgrade in the United States and in English only. It’ll be available in more countries like the United Kingdom later this December. And in 2025, it’ll expand to other languages like Spanish.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868495/19272" target="_top" id="1868495">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868495" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868495/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Camera-Upgrades"><a href="#2-Camera-Upgrades" class="headerlink" title="2. Camera Upgrades"></a>2. Camera Upgrades</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Apple showed off so many camera updates at the event that it is impossible to talk about every single one in detail, but we’re going to try. First, the main lens on the iPhone 16 will be the new 48MP Fusion Camera. It can take wide-angle shots like previous generations. Now it sports a 2x Telephoto option for taking clear pictures from far away. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Below the power button is a new tactile switch called <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/" >Camera Control <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a special sensor allowing you to control the camera with a few light touches. A light tap instantly opens the Camera app and a few more light touches can be used to adjust the composition. You can zoom in on a subject, adjust the exposure, or change the depth of view. The best part of Camera Control is it’ll soon become accessible on third-party apps.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982508%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982508/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Eye-catching-colors"><a href="#3-Eye-catching-colors" class="headerlink" title="3. Eye-catching colors"></a>3. Eye-catching colors</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Every generation of iPhones brings with it new colors. For this release, Apple decided to go bold. The shades are some of the most vibrant we’ve seen in the series, especially that bubble-gum Pink iPhone. You also have the option to go for Ultramarine Blue or muted Teal Green. Of course, you still have the classic options of Black and White. </p><p>The Pro models go for a more striking design. Desert Titanium adorns their brushed metal, making the iPhones look like they’ve been forged from bronze. If you prefer something a little more low-key, the Pro models are available in the equally impressive Black, White, and Natural Titanium too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075462/7443" target="_top" id="2075462">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075462" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075462/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Design-changes-bring-other-benefits"><a href="#4-Design-changes-bring-other-benefits" class="headerlink" title="4. Design changes bring other benefits"></a>4. Design changes bring other benefits</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>There’s more to the iPhone 16’s design besides color as Apple made multiple changes. We’ve already talked about the camera array and the Camera Control switch. What you may not know is the company made its mobile device tougher. It is covered in the “latest-generation Ceramic Shield”, making the iPhone 16 15% more durable than before. The glass has also been twice as tough to withstand drops.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/" >Every iPhone model that will be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones won’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple even updated the iPhone 16’s internal design, allowing the device to dissipate heat better. This means lower internal temperatures, which results in a healthier battery. The optimization allowed for more room, too, resulting in an even larger battery. The base model can last up to 22 hours on a single charge. The Action Button makes a return, giving users quick access to various functions, from activating the Translate tool to turning on Shazam.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

Yes, but there are definitely some points to consider.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-wants-you-to-know-what-youre-missing-by-not-upgrading-to-an-iphone-15/"><strong>Apple wants you to know what you’re missing by not upgrading to an iPhone 15</strong></a></p><p>The iPhone 15 series starts at <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >$799 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and ranges <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >up to $1,199 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, so I wouldn’t go as far as to say that it’s an easy buying decision for budget-minded shoppers. If you do fall into that group however, allow me to direct you to ZDNET’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-deals/" >best iPhone deals <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> guide instead.</p><p>But if you’re dead set on the latest generation of Apple handsets, let this decision tree help you make the best purchase for your needs, use cases, and preferences. I guarantee that one of the four iPhone 15 models will resonate with you more than the others.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make

How is this different than the telephoto lens found on the smaller Pro model? A periscope lens allows the iPhone to capture distant subjects with a 5x optical zoom as opposed to a digital one, which translates to greater detail and less blurriness.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-review/" >iPhone 15 Pro review: Coming from iPhone 12 Pro or earlier?

You can’t justify the $200 Max Tax</h3><p>Due to the hardware gap, Apple is charging an extra $100 for the Pro Max model this year, making a $200 difference between the bigger device and the regular Pro. That’s a hefty sum, and is enough to cover a case, screen protector, and USB-C charging case – should you want to update your AirPods Pro to Apple’s new port standard.

Like the Pro Max, the iPhone 15 Plus features a 6.8-inch panel with a similar-behaving Dynamic Island interface.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/" >iPhone 15 review: I spent a month with Apple’s base model and found it more ‘Pro’ than ever <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The display doesn’t get quite as smooth with a 60Hz refresh rate, and the speakers are not as punchy as the Pro Max’s, but if you just want an iPhone that gets the basics right, and looks good doing them, then the 15 Plus is the way to go.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Buy the iPhone 15 Plus $899 at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997717/19272" target="_top" id="1997717">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997717" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997717/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-iPhone-15-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-iPhone-15-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the iPhone 15 if…"></a>You should buy the iPhone 15 if…</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h3 id="1-You-want-the-latest-iPhone-for-less"><a href="#1-You-want-the-latest-iPhone-for-less" class="headerlink" title="1.

One of the colors suits your vibe</h3><p>Smartphones are arguably our most personal piece of technology, so something as basic as color can be a deciding factor when purchasing one. Apple tends to give the non-Pro iPhones the more poppy and adventurous colors, with this year’s crop getting splashes of pastel yellow, pink, blue, white, and black. If one of those colors speaks to you, then it may be your calling to opt for an iPhone 15 instead of an iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Buy the iPhone 15 $799 at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884002/19272" target="_top" id="1884002">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884002" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884002/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-14&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >BEST IPHONE 15 ALTERNATIVE iPhone 14 Last year’s iPhone 14 doesn’t have a Dynamic Island, but it’s nearly as capable as the iPhone 15 in every other regard.

Apple inundated its audience with so many reveals that it’s difficult to cover everything in detail. </p><p>However, the question remains: Is it worth upgrading to the iPhone 16? Below is a short list of the three features that’ll make you eager to upgrade as soon as possible.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Camera-Control-button"><a href="#1-Camera-Control-button" class="headerlink" title="1. Camera Control button"></a>1. Camera Control button</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The iPhone 16 receives a substantial update to its camera system. The device possesses a 48MP Fusion lens capable of taking wide-angle photographs and far-away shots, thanks to its 2X telephoto option. But what really caught my attention was the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/" >Camera Control button <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The button acts as a camera shortcut of sorts. Pushing it takes a photo, but the button also supports gesture controls. Swiping on the button with your thumb or finger lets you zoom in or out, while a double light-press presents you with various shooting modes, zoom lengths, photographic styles, and more. It’s a fun and intuitive way to take photos. The best part about the button is that it’s a great way to introduce more people to photography.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424527">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424527">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424527%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424527/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Siri-2-0-is-arriving-very-soon"><a href="#2-Siri-2-0-is-arriving-very-soon" class="headerlink" title="2.

Siri 2.0 is arriving very soon</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-new-feature-apple-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-mac-and-more-this-fall-including-ai/" >Back during WWDC 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple announced Siri would receive a much-needed upgrade. The company said Siri would gain conversational context, so it remembers what you just told it, and would soon be able to “take actions across apps”. As it turns out, the AI is obtaining exactly those features – and a whole lot more.</p><p>The new Siri can engage in more natural conversations. Users no longer need to constantly say the AI’s name over and over again to issue a command. Just saying “Siri” once is enough and you can then continue talking to the AI like you would a regular person. What’s more, Siri can understand you better – even if you make a mistake. Stuttering or mispeaking won’t ruin the input. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-will-improve-siri-in-2024-but-dont-expect-most-updates-until-2025/" >Apple Intelligence will improve SIri in 2024, but don’t expect most updates until 2025 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Everything mentioned so far is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s been reported that next year Siri will be able to find and act on items on-device based on your context. For example, you could ask the AI what time your mom’s flight is landing and Siri will pull together information from texts and emails, and then present this insight to you in a brief response.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080317/19272" target="_top" id="2080317">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080317" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080317/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-A-new-AI-powered-chipset"><a href="#3-A-new-AI-powered-chipset" class="headerlink" title="3.

The iPad Mini was last updated in the fall of 2021 with new features like support for the second-gen Apple Pencil, a slightly bigger screen size, and a USB-C port for charging and data transfer.</p><p>There’s a spot on the right side of the tablet to charge the Apple Pencil, making it a great tablet for drawing or writing notes. Customers who bought the iPad Mini reported in reviews that they were impressed by its battery life, durability, and display. They also noted its portability to fit in purses and bags, particularly for entertainment purposes. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-6th-generation-tablet-64-gb-8-3-mk7p3lla/"><strong>Apple iPad Mini (6th Gen.)</strong></a></p><p>ZDNET Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner tested the iPad Mini and said that it “feels more like an [oversized] smartphone than a small tablet at times.”</p><p>“It can easily slip into bags, purses, and even the pockets of some cargo pants and vests,” he wrote. “Compared to a phone, it’s better for reading ebooks, PDFs, documents, news apps, and other digital content – especially when leaning back in a chair or a couch.”</p><p>Of course, you’ll also get iPadOS 16 with features like shared tab groups, Stage Manager, and external display support if you ever need to see something on a bigger screen. Ultimately, you get all these things for less than what you would pay for an iPad Air or an iPad Pro. </p><p><strong>iPad Mini tech specs: Display</strong>: 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display | <strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic | <strong>Storage</strong>: 64GB or 256GB | <strong>Colors</strong>: Space gray, pink, purple, starlight | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 8MP rear, 1080p video. 12MP FaceTime camera with Center Stage | <strong>Weight</strong>: 0.65 pounds | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 7.69 x 5.3 x 0.25 inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: USB-C | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 10 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/dp/B096WKKK2K?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cef5ef060-555c-4bf1-a6c8-86fa93e46d4c%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazon-fire-7-2022-7-tablet-with-wi-fi-16-gb-black/6508109.p?skuId=6508109&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Good battery life</li><li>Can double as an Alexa smart display</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Performance is slightly slow</li><li>Cameras aren’t as great as other options</li></ul><h2 id="Amazon-Fire-7-Tablet"><a href="#Amazon-Fire-7-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Fire 7 Tablet"></a>Amazon Fire 7 Tablet</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918684/19272" target="_top" id="1918684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918684/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-budget-small-tablet"><a href="#Best-budget-small-tablet" class="headerlink" title="Best budget small tablet"></a>Best budget small tablet</h3><p>If you’re looking for something even smaller and cheaper than the iPad Mini, the Amazon Fire 7 tablet is a great budget tablet pick. The Fire tablet’s 7-inch screen has a 1024 x 600 display, so you can stream movies or play video games without hauling around a bulky tablet. </p><p>Former ZDNET contributor Jason Cipriani reviewed the Amazon Fire 7 tablet and said it offers “a well-rounded experience as long as you take the cost into account when setting expectations.” Even though performance may be a bit slow, Cipriani said that’s expected at a price point like $60, considering the tablet is a colorful Kindle, a dedicated Alexa smart display, and a smart home controller, all in one device.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-fire-7-2022-review/"><strong>Amazon Fire 7 (2022)</strong></a></p><p>Along with the ability to ask Alexa questions, you can view and manage your Alexa-connected smart home devices. You can control cameras, lights, and outlets using your voice or by tapping the dedicated Devices button in the bottom navigation bar. </p><p>Overall, 90% of Best Buy customers who bought the Amazon Fire 7 tablet would recommend it to a friend, giving it an average rating of 4.5 out of 5.</p><p><strong>Amazon Fire 7 tech specs: Display</strong>: 7-inch, 1024x600 display | <strong>Processor</strong>: MediaTek MT8168V&#x2F;B | <strong>Storage</strong>: 16GB or 326GB | <strong>Colors</strong>: Black, denim, or rose | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording| <strong>Weight</strong>: 9.9 ounces | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 7.11 x 4.63 x 0.38 inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: 2 USB-C, 3.5mm jack | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 10 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1773404-REG/boox%5Ftab%5Fmini%5Fc%5F7%5F8%5Fe%5Fink%5Ftablet.html/BI/23252/KBID/28790/SID/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp" >View now at B&amp;H Photo-Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Long lasting battery life</li><li>Gorgeous design and display</li><li>Great templates for taking notes</li><li>Easy reading</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Some complaints of lag</li></ul><h2 id="Boox-Tab-Mini-C"><a href="#Boox-Tab-Mini-C" class="headerlink" title="Boox Tab Mini C"></a>Boox Tab Mini C</h2><h3 id="Best-small-tablet-for-note-taking"><a href="#Best-small-tablet-for-note-taking" class="headerlink" title="Best small tablet for note-taking"></a>Best small tablet for note-taking</h3><p>Boox is an e-reader and drawing tablet with a vivid color display, so your e-book’s illustrations will pop as you read, and so will your color-coordinated notes. Speaking of which, the note-taking templates on the Tab Mini C are handy. Whether you’re a student taking Cornell-style notes, a desk job employee making an hourly plan for your day, a musician crafting a piece of sheet music, or a historian drafting a timeline, the Tab Mini C offers a template for that. </p><p>Another fun feature is the tablet’s four customizable refresh modes. These modes are helpful for streaming videos on YouTube and needing a smoother display or for e-reading and not minding a clunkier refresh. With adjustable warm and cool lights, you can customize your desired blue light level to tone the display before bedtime for an easier-on-the-eyes reading experience. </p><p>ZDNET editor Nina Raemont, who contributed to this article, has been using the tablet to manage her work-life calendar, build lists for grocery shopping, meeting agendas, and more. It’s become Raemont’s deskside companion and staple note-taking device.

We also looked at a tablet’s weight to ensure they were portable.</li><li><strong>Display:</strong> Small tablets shouldn’t have to compromise on an already smaller display, so we also considered display resolution.</li><li><strong>Battery life:</strong> A device’s battery life is important no matter its size, so we considered devices that can last you all day.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> Tablets vary in price range from affordable to expensive depending on brand and purpose, so we made sure to choose tablets at various price points to accommodate different budgets.</li></ul><h2 id="How-we-test-tablets"><a href="#How-we-test-tablets" class="headerlink" title="How we test tablets"></a>How we test tablets</h2><p>The ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tested in the real world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Display</strong>: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.<br>We also compare the display’s performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen’s responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer’s stylus.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet’s temperature during intensive tasks.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.</li><li><strong>Camera and audio:</strong> For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tablet testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087239/19272" target="_top" id="2087239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087239/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-smallest-tablet-screen-size"><a href="#What-is-the-smallest-tablet-screen-size" class="headerlink" title="What is the smallest tablet screen size?"></a>What is the smallest tablet screen size?</h2><p>The smallest tablet screen size on the market is 6 to 7 inches.

To demonstrate, if you travel often, one with a smaller screen will be perfect for carrying&#x2F;using on an airplane.

Amazon has well-rounded tablets in its Fire lineup but with fewer performance-focused features. Boox is also proving to be an industry underdog, with impressive tablets that function as e-readers and illustrators. </p><p>Keep in mind in certain cases (Apple, Samsung), you can pair your other devices with the tablet. In the case of Apple tablets, you can log in using your Apple ID to access the same apps, pictures, and more from your phone on your iPad. </p><p>Meanwhile, with Samsung devices, you can implement Samsung Flow.

It can now check your heart rate, carry your boarding pass for a flight, identify a song that’s playing nearby, open your garage door, alert you when it’s about to rain, and guide you to breathe when you get stressed – and those are just a few examples. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/"><strong>The best smartwatches: Expert tested</strong></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-right-now"><a href="#What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What is the best Apple Watch right now?"></a>What is the best Apple Watch right now?</h2><p>Based on my years of testing, my pick for the best Apple Watch overall is the <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-ultra-2-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-orange-beige-trail-loop-medium-large-titanium/6574421.p?skuId=6574421&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thanks to its large screen, 24-hour battery life, and emergency siren.

The most notable and useful difference between the Ultra and the other Apple Watch models is the larger, brighter, flatter screen that’s covered by a sapphire crystal face and surrounded by a titanium case to considerably increase the amount of wear and tear it can handle. It’s also IPX6 dust resistant, works underwater up to 100 meters (328 feet), and has military-grade (MIL-STD 810H) certification for ruggedness. Plus, the Ultra 2 can handle high altitudes, shocks, vibrations, and temperatures as low as 4 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 130 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-spent-a-week-with-the-apple-watch-ultra-2-and-heres-what-stood-out-the-most/" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>ZDNET contributing writer Matthew Miller also tried out the Apple Watch Ultra 2 when it was released last year, and said he enjoyed the watch “for its long battery life, brighter display, expanded connectivity, and new watch bands” while also being impressed by the improved mental health functionality via the Mindfulness app.</p><p>The Ultra 2 adds more exclusive features as well, including a programmable Action Button with a variety of workout and adventuring functions (it can also simply activate the flashlight), dual-frequency GPS that can overcome interference from mountains and skyscrapers, and dual integrated speakers that are much louder for taking phone calls, playing music, or interacting with Siri. </p><p>Many Amazon reviewers who have bought this watch say that it’s the best Apple Watch model they have ever used, calling out the watch’s quality and large 49mm screen with 3,000 nits of brightness in particular. Beyond that, the Ultra offers one key addition to the Apple Watch Series 9 lineup: an emergency siren (activated by holding down the Action Button), which belts out an 86-decibel sound pattern that can be heard up to 600 feet (180 meters) away. This can help if you get lost or take a fall on a hike to ward off wild animals or to scare off attackers.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2 tech specs</strong>: <strong>Display Size:</strong> 49mm | <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 72 hours | <strong>Storage capacity:</strong> 64GB | <strong>Features:</strong> Sturdy titanium case and sapphire crystal face, enhanced safety features including a built-in siren, dual-frequency GPS, works up to 100 meters underwater</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSTJML9X/ref=asc_df_B0CSTJML9X1726830000000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0CSTJML9X&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cdad2286f-c8e7-4d3d-9f52-ebaaead01fa6%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=6574327&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F6574327.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Brighter screen</li><li>Full array of health sensors</li><li>Hands-free double-tap gesture</li><li>More accurate Siri commands</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Cellular connectivity costs extra</li><li>Not as durable as the Ultra 2</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-Watch-Series-9"><a href="#Apple-Watch-Series-9" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch Series 9"></a>Apple Watch Series 9</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144276/7443" target="_top" id="2144276">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144276" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144276/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-most-people"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-most-people" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for most people"></a>Best Apple Watch for most people</h3><p>The Apple Watch Series 9 can track activity, steps, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen (lung function), wrist temperature, sleep, and environmental sound levels (to protect your hearing), all of which customers who have reviewed the watch say “make day to day living so much easier.” And it uses algorithms and machine learning to spot dangerous patterns and alert you to seek medical attention if needed. There are now <a class="link"   href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-watch-lifesaving-health-features-read-5-peoples-stories/" >many stories of people who’ve had life-saving experiences <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with health alerts from an Apple Watch. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9</strong></a></p><p>In my hands-on testing, there are two big upgrades in the Apple Watch Series 9. The first is a 2,000 nit display that is double the brightness of last year’s S8. The second is the new S9 SiP processor, which has a 30% faster GPU and processes machine learning twice as fast. This makes everything quicker, makes the animations smoother, and enables features like the new double-tap gesture and faster and more accurate Siri commands.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-apple-watch-series-8/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Apple Watch Series 8: Should you upgrade?</strong></a></p><p>If you want the latest health sensors and safety features, great battery life (especially if you want to do sleep tracking), and you don’t need the extreme features in the Ultra 2, then you can save a lot of money by going with the aluminum model of the Apple Watch Series 9 starting at $399. However, if you decide you want the tougher stainless steel finish (starting at $699), then I’d say skip that and go straight to the Ultra because for $100 more, you get a lot of extra features. The one exception to that might be if you have a smaller wrist.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 tech specs: Display size:</strong> 41mm or 45mm | <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 36 hours | <strong>Storage capacity:</strong> 64GB | <strong>Features:</strong> New features include a 2x brighter display, double-tap gesture, new pink color, robust S9 processor, and all the best health sensors Apple has to offer</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-se-2nd-generation-gps-40mm-starlight-aluminum-case-with-starlight-sport-band-s-m-starlight/6340296.p?skuId=6340296&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Sleep-Tracker-Crash-Detection-Heart-Rate-Monitor/5033741510&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Family Setup for kids and older adults</li><li>Health and location tracking</li><li>Fall and crash detection</li><li>Very affordable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Not as durable as other Apple Watch models</li><li>Cellular connection requires a monthly fee</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424527">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424527">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424527%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424527/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-generation"><a href="#Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-generation" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch SE (2nd generation)"></a>Apple Watch SE (2nd generation)</h2><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-kids-and-first-time-buyers"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-kids-and-first-time-buyers" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for kids and first-time buyers"></a>Best Apple Watch for kids and first-time buyers</h3><p>Starting at $249, what I found amazing about the Apple Watch SE (2nd gen) is how many of the same health and safety features from the Series 8 and the Ultra it actually includes. It’s easier to talk about what’s not included in the SE – it doesn’t track blood oxygen, do ECG heart checks, or check your temperature. And while the face looks just like the Series 8, the screen is actually about 20% smaller, and it also doesn’t have an always-on display.</p><p>Still, it includes nearly everything else, and the cellular connectivity is only a $50 add-on for the SE (compared to a $100 add-on for the Series 8). Like the Ultra and the Series 8, adding a cellular connection will also cost you about $10&#x2F;month with your wireless carrier. Even if you go with the cellular version and opt for the larger 44mm Apple Watch SE over the smaller 40mm version, you’ll still only top out at $329.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-se-2022-vs-apple-watch-se-2020-should-you-upgrade/" >Apple Watch SE (2022) vs Apple Watch SE (2020): Should you upgrade? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That makes it a great smartwatch to give to someone who doesn’t have an iPhone, such as a child or an elderly family member, using <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768" >Apple’s Family Setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With cellular connectivity, they can use the Apple Watch to make and receive phone calls, get text messages, dictate replies to texts, and connect to online info like the weather. </p><p>You can even set it up from your iPhone as long as they are in your Apple family group. If you are connecting an elderly relative who has health issues, the added health sensors in the Series 8 might make it worth the peace of mind to upgrade. Customers who have reviewed the watch also agree that it offers excellent value for the price, especially if you are new to the Apple Watch family.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch SE tech specs: Display size:</strong> 40mm or 44mm | <strong>Battery life</strong>: Up to 18 hours | <strong>Storage capacity:</strong> 32GB | <strong>Features:</strong> Most affordable Apple Watch, family setup for kids and older adults, health and location tracking, and fall and crash detection</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Green-Aluminum-Clover/dp/B09HF1DC1J?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cdad2286f-c8e7-4d3d-9f52-ebaaead01fa6%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Comes in unique blue and green colors</li><li>Good deal if you buy used or refurbished</li><li>Has most of the latest health features</li><li>Water, dust, and crack resistant</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Shorter battery life than the Series 8 or Series 9</li><li>Display isn’t as bright as the Series 9</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-Watch-Series-7"><a href="#Apple-Watch-Series-7" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch Series 7"></a>Apple Watch Series 7</h2><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-unique-colors"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-unique-colors" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for unique colors"></a>Best Apple Watch for unique colors</h3><p>When it first launched in fall 2021, the Apple Watch Series 7 brought key upgrades including a 20% larger screen, fast charging (0% to 80% in 45 minutes with a USB-C cable), a more durable face that’s made out of crystal and is 50% thicker than the previous model, and IPX6 dust resistance. Those are features that still aren’t available on the Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-7-review/" >Apple Watch Series 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>With the SE now holding down the entry-level Apple Watch market, it’s best to think about buying the Series 7 in comparison to the SE. If you just want a low-cost entry into the Apple Watch ecosystem and an easy purchase, then you can buy a new SE and quickly get started. A new Apple Watch Series 7 costs nearly the same price as the Series 8, so it’s much better to get the Series 8. However, you can find a refurbished Series 7 for $200-$250 on places like <a class="link"   href="https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/l/apple-watch/38fd0158-d500-43d2-817c-738859e3e7dd#model=999%20Apple%20Watch%20Series%207" >BackMarket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.refurb.me/refurbished/apple-watch/series-7" >RefurbMe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Amazon also sells refurbished models, and the overall reviews from customers who bought a previously owned Apple Watch Series 7 were positive, with no complaints about battery life or the condition of the watch.</p><p>There are really only a few great reasons to buy the Series 7 at this point. The first is if you want the additional health features (heart and lung tracking) for an Apple Watch you’re giving to an elderly relative or if you want the extra durability for an Apple Watch you’re giving to a kid. The other big reason to buy the Series 7 is that it comes in two really nice colors – green and blue – that Apple no longer offers for the Series 8. But again, if you’re going to get a Series 7, I’d recommend getting a refurbished one.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 7 tech specs: Display size:</strong> 41mm or 45mm | <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 18 hours | <strong>Storage</strong>: 32GB | <strong>Features:</strong> Large display, fast charging, health-focused features, and more durable than the SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-hermes/&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>High-quality, stylish bands</li><li>Exclusive Hermès watch faces</li><li>Includes an extra Sports Band in the box</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Expensive for what you get</li><li>Same features as regular Series 9</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134233/18498" target="_top" id="2134233">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134233" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134233/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Apple-Watch-Hermes"><a href="#Apple-Watch-Hermes" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch Hermès"></a>Apple Watch Hermès</h2><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-dressing-up"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-dressing-up" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for dressing up"></a>Best Apple Watch for dressing up</h3><p>If you’re looking to splurge on a designer smartwatch, the Apple Watch Hermès is a chic option for fashionistas.

Here’s a quick summary of the primary reason to buy each one.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Choose this Apple Watch…</strong></th><th><strong>If you want…</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple Watch Ultra 2</td><td>All the best smartwatch features Apple has to offer. While the Ultra 2 is especially loaded with fitness and durability features for athletes and adventurers, its larger and brighter display, better battery life, and emergency siren will appeal to many others as well.</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch Series 9</td><td>All the latest health and fitness features at an approachable price. It tracks heart health, breathing, temperature, sleep, and, of course, activity and fitness. The Apple Watch keeps getting smarter, and this is the best-selling model.</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch SE</td><td>A more budget-friendly Apple Watch. This includes all the basic features at a lower price and is a great pick for first-time Apple Watch buyers or to give to a kid or an elderly family member, since you can configure it using Family Setup even if they don’t have an iPhone.</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch Series 7</td><td>An Apple Watch in unique blue or green colors. The Apple Watch Series 7 is for sale in many places, and you can get a refurbished model for $200 to $275. The best reason to get it is the fact that it comes in two unique colors you can’t get in the Series 9.</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch Hermès</td><td>An Apple Watch for dressing up as well as working out. For those who love the French luxury brand, this special edition of the Apple Watch features premium bands and exclusive watch faces for those who view their timepiece as a fashion accessory.</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918679/19272" target="_top" id="1918679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Factors-to-consider-when-choosing-the-best-Apple-Watch"><a href="#Factors-to-consider-when-choosing-the-best-Apple-Watch" class="headerlink" title="Factors to consider when choosing the best Apple Watch"></a>Factors to consider when choosing the best Apple Watch</h2><p>While all the Apple Watches on this list have a slew of health-tracking features and other useful apps, their differences are what you need to consider before buying one, including: </p><ul><li><strong>Display size:</strong> Apple Watch displays now come in essentially three different sizes (40&#x2F;41, 44&#x2F;45, and 49). Depending on the size of your wrist and how much you want to interact with the watch for quick actions, the display size will be a big factor in determining which model makes the most sense.</li><li><strong>Features:</strong> Apple methodically adds more and more new features to the Apple Watch each year, so we compared safety features, health sensors, band options, battery life, and other useful options.</li><li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Each Apple Watch has a number of different variations, so pricing can vary widely – especially based on which band you pick. We included budget-worthy options below $250, as well as the more premium options that are over $1,000.</li></ul><h2 id="How-we-test-smartwatches"><a href="#How-we-test-smartwatches" class="headerlink" title="How we test smartwatches"></a>How we test smartwatches</h2><p>All of the Apple Watches included in this list were chosen based on how they performed when <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-smartwatches-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tested in the real world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by the ZDNET team. When we test smartwatches, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Daily wear</strong>: We wear the smartwatch as our primary watch, with communications, applications, and other elements being tested as if it were our only smartwatch.</li><li><strong>Application selection and performance</strong>: One aspect that makes smartwatches different than standard watches is the support for applications. We load up the watch with apps and then test the performance and functionality of those applications. For example, Apple particularly excels in the area of third-party application support.</li><li><strong>Workouts</strong>: Smartwatch makers have embraced health and fitness so we take smartwatches out for running with GPS, rowing on the Hydrow, biking on trails, and walking with the family. GPS and heart rate data is tracked and then we evaluate the accuracy against proven GPS sports watches.</li><li><strong>Sleep and activity tracking:</strong> Sleep tracking has improved with smartwatches over time and we evaluate and compare them to smart rings and other watches. Nighttime is also a good time to charge your smartwatch, so you may choose not to use your watch to track sleep so your watch can serve faithfully all day and into the night.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-smartwatches-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >smartwatch testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="What-is-new-in-the-Apple-Watch-10"><a href="#What-is-new-in-the-Apple-Watch-10" class="headerlink" title="What is new in the Apple Watch 10?"></a>What is new in the Apple Watch 10?</h2><p>Apple just announced the new Apple Watch Series 10 during its September event, and there are several notable features. First, the screen sizes are bigger (42 mm and 46 mm), and Apple said this is the thinnest Apple Watch to date, meaning it should be more comfortable on your wrist. </p><p>The Series 10 also has a new <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-10-gains-sleep-apnea-detection-and-it-could-save-your-life/" >sleep apnea-tracking feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which monitors movements associated with respiratory pattern interruptions and is tracked by Apple’s new Breathing Disturbances metric. </p><p>There is also a new depth gauge, which measures up to six meters beneath the water’s surface, and a water temperature sensor, which is great if you’re into water sports. </p><p>Finally, the Apple Watch 10 has a new jet black finish, along with “updated” rose gold and brushed silver aluminum finishes. </p><p>The Apple Watch 10 costs $399 and is available Friday, September 20.

The Apple Watch Series 8 introduced a more scratch-resistant crystal face, a temperature sensor, next-gen motion tracking, crash detection, and emergency SOS (all of which are also included in the Series 9).

Its design makes it more durable and water-resistant (up to 100m) than the other Apple Watch models, and it includes an Action Button for fine-tuning workouts and hikes.</p><h2 id="What-Apple-Watch-is-best-for-kids"><a href="#What-Apple-Watch-is-best-for-kids" class="headerlink" title="What Apple Watch is best for kids?"></a>What Apple Watch is best for kids?</h2><p>While it’s not made specifically with kids in mind, the Apple Watch SE is an excellent smartwatch for older kids with standout features plus parental controls.

Instead of viewing a phone for your child as a negative thing, you can gain peace of mind with the ability to track their location and contact them directly no matter where they are, or who they are with.

The most inexpensive iPhone is the iPhone SE, which starts at $429. Apple revamped the iPhone SE in 2022 with the same processor as the more expensive iPhone 13 lineup. I went hands-on with the iPhone SE, and the end result was an iPhone 13-like experience in a phone that’s half the price. </p><p>The phone features a 4.7-inch display and a Touch ID home button that your child can use to secure their iPhone with a fingerprint. The rear camera takes photos that are nearly as clear and crisp as higher-end iPhones, while the front camera provides a solid FaceTime experience. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-iphone-se-2022-review/"><strong>Apple iPhone SE: You simply can’t find a better phone at this price</strong></a></p><p>In addition to excellent hardware at a reasonable price, you’re also getting access to Screen Time parental controls, Find My, Family Sharing, and the rest of Apple’s software services. For a family that’s heavily invested in Apple products, the iPhone SE is a great starter phone for kids. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/z24y4x/phones%5Ffor%5Fa%5Fkid%5Fage%5F11parental%5Fcontrols/" >Parents on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> who purchased the iPhone SE for their child praised the parental control options and how easy the phone is to use for young kids. </p><p><strong>Apple iPhone SE tech specs: Display:</strong> 4.7-inch | <strong>Processor:</strong> Apple A15 Bionic | <strong>Memory:</strong> 4GB | <strong>Storage:</strong> 64&#x2F;128&#x2F;256GB | <strong>Rear cameras:</strong> 12MP | <strong>Front camera:</strong> 7MP FaceTime Camera | <strong>Battery:</strong> 2,018 mAh | <strong>Cost:</strong> Around $429</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/battery-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera-Indigo/dp/B09BTB5MKT/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C3d5bbd18-4325-46cf-9b2b-2174b7cb31a5%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-moto-g-pure-32gb-memory-unlocked-deep-indigo/6476149.p?skuId=6476149&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Large display</li><li>Good battery</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Somewhat slow performance</li><li>Low internal storage</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896546/19272" target="_top" id="1896546">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896546" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896546/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Moto-G-Pure"><a href="#Moto-G-Pure" class="headerlink" title="Moto G Pure"></a>Moto G Pure</h2><h3 id="Best-starter-phone-for-kids"><a href="#Best-starter-phone-for-kids" class="headerlink" title="Best starter phone for kids"></a>Best starter phone for kids</h3><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/moto-g-pure-brings-mediatek-processor-to-us-with-159-99-device/" >Moto G Pure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an incredibly affordable phone that offers a basic experience.

The Moto G Pure has a decent camera setup, 3.5mm headphone jack, large battery (helpful for kids who love playing games), and large display, </p><p>However, there are two potential downsides to the G Pure: Storage and speed. With 32GB of internal storage, you’ll want to add a 512GB microSD card to make room for pictures, videos, apps and games. </p><p>Performance will be slower than what you’d find on an iPhone and other phones on this list. However, verified customers on Amazon said that for a kids phone, the performance, battery life, and value is good enough as a starter phone.</p><p><strong>Moto G Pure tech specs: Display:</strong> 6.5-inch | <strong>Processor:</strong> MediaTek Helio G25 | <strong>Memory:</strong> 3GB | <strong>Storage:</strong> 32GB, microSD card support | <strong>Rear cameras:</strong> 13MP, 2MP, depth sensor | <strong>Front camera:</strong> 5MP | <strong>Battery:</strong> 4,000 mAh | <strong>Cost:</strong> Around $159</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/653132363&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09P484865/ref=asc_df_B09P4848651727262000000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B09P484865&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C3d5bbd18-4325-46cf-9b2b-2174b7cb31a5%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Good price</li><li>Great cameras</li><li>Solid battery life</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Limited internal storage</li></ul><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-A32-5G"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-A32-5G" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy A32 5G"></a>Samsung Galaxy A32 5G</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398455/3022" target="_top" id="398455">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398455" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398455/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-kids’-phone-for-Samsung-families"><a href="#Best-kids’-phone-for-Samsung-families" class="headerlink" title="Best kids’ phone for Samsung families"></a>Best kids’ phone for Samsung families</h3><p>Samsung isn’t known for low-end smartphones.

Not only have I tested these devices myself, but I’ve experienced my own kids reaching the age of needing their first phone. All five of these picks are something I would (and have) trust(ed) my kids to take care of. </p><p>ZDNET does extensive hands-on testing of phones, including ease of use, and paying attention to specs like display, battery life, and overall experience while using the phone. For products we recommend, we write a product spotlight review that we update periodically with new features and pricing information.</p><p>For the phones we have not gone hands-on with, we do extensive research into different products and brands, taking into consideration user reviews (both good and bad), competitor analysis, and more. </p><h2 id="What-about-parental-controls-for-a-kids-phone"><a href="#What-about-parental-controls-for-a-kids-phone" class="headerlink" title="What about parental controls for a kids phone?"></a>What about parental controls for a kids phone?</h2><p>Both Apple and Google have their own respective solutions for adding parental controls to an iPhone or Android phone. For iPhone users, you’ll want to enable <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982" >Screen Time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your child’s phone.

However, if you want to buy a phone outright without getting locked into device payments, you can always start with a prepaid carrier like Republic Wireless or Visible. The plans are cheap, and you’re not committed to paying the carrier back for a phone if your child loses it. </p><p>If you opt to add a line to your account, most carriers allow you to mix and match plans. For example, you can have your number on a plan that allows unlimited data usage at full speed, and then give your child a plan that forfeits data speed when the network is busy. It saves you money while still giving your child access to everything they need a phone to do. </p><h2 id="Are-there-apps-built-in-to-keep-track-of-my-kid’s-location"><a href="#Are-there-apps-built-in-to-keep-track-of-my-kid’s-location" class="headerlink" title="Are there apps built in to keep track of my kid’s location?"></a>Are there apps built in to keep track of my kid’s location?</h2><p>Yes! If you set up Screen Time on an iPhone, you’ll also set up Apple’s Family Share feature that includes Find My. Find My is not only what you use to track down a lost iPhone, iPad, or Mac, but it’s also used to keep tabs on friends or loved ones. </p><p>Google Family Link offers the same functionality, or you can add your child to Google Maps’ Location Sharing feature. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-gps-track-a-phone/" >Did you lose a device?

It features an adjustable stand with 8 configurations, a bumper and rugged shell for added drop protection, a stylus pocket, wireless charging capabilities, and more. Plus, Zugu has cases available for preorder for the new M4 iPad Pro models. </p><p>I tested this Zugu case on my iPad Air (pictured above) for the past few weeks along with several other cases, it’s my favorite. It’s extremely functional but still practical, providing true security from bumps and drops (not just operating as a light cover). I loved using it as a stand, especially while testing several note-taking apps this month. The material feels premium and expensive with a clean, appealing design. </p><p>And while the functionality is top-notch, my favorite thing about the Zugu case is the color. I’ve been using the case in the Desert Rose color, and as a true Gen-Z corporate girl, I love it. Many companies don’t cater to colors outside of black, white, tan, and brown, so the unique color choices are awesome, but I still wish there were more fun prints and designs. The new iPad Pro model cases also have limited colors for now, but I expect to see more soon.</p><p>Current customers on the Zugu website said they like the overall protection, functionality, quality, and aesthetic of the Zugu case. Many said the case is a great value and has a premium feel, and one customer even said they wished they’d found Zugu sooner. </p><p>What’s even better is that Zugu will pay a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zugucase.com/pages/free-ipad-repairs" >one-time AppleCare+ repair fee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if your iPad is damaged while in a Zugu case. The Zugu case is well worth the money in my opinion, and it’s a solid all-around case for style and protection.</p><p><strong>Zugu iPad Pro Case features:</strong> Adjustable stand with 8 angles | Bumper and rugged shell for drop protection | Air flow vents | Secure magnetic mount capability | Microfiber interior | Auto sleep&#x2F;wake magnetic cover | Stylus pocket on back | Wireless Apple Pencil charging compatibility | Free AppleCare+ Repair Fee</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://burga.sjv.io/c/159047/1270603/15631?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%253A%252F%252Fus.burga.com%252Fproducts%252Fmath-exam-ipad-pro-12-9-6th-5th-gen-case%253Fvariant%253D47811892412744%2526type%253DFolio&subId1=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Burga <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Fun designs and patterns</li><li>Folio style</li><li>Apple Pencil storage&#x2F;charging</li><li>Doubles as stand</li><li>Under $100</li><li>Shock absorption</li><li>Raised bezel design</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Stand configurations could be more comfortable</li><li>Folio front feels a bit flimsy</li><li>No cases for new 13-inch iPad Pro</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884017/19272" target="_top" id="1884017">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884017" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884017/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Burga-iPad-Pro-Case"><a href="#Burga-iPad-Pro-Case" class="headerlink" title="Burga iPad Pro Case"></a>Burga iPad Pro Case</h2><h3 id="Best-basic-iPad-Pro-case-for-style"><a href="#Best-basic-iPad-Pro-case-for-style" class="headerlink" title="Best basic iPad Pro case for style"></a>Best basic iPad Pro case for style</h3><p>Burga’s folio case for the iPad Pro combines style and function. It features a spot for stylus storage and Apple Pencil charging, has a hard shell backing and a soft close folio front, can be used as stand for your iPad, features shock absorption and a raised bezel design, and is overall sleek in profile. </p><p>When I tested the Burga case on the iPad Air the last few weeks (pictured above) I liked its light weight, handy Apple Pencil storage, folio style cover, stand configuration, and numerous prints and designs. It’s a great basic case to protect from everyday bumps and scratches, but I recommend bumping up to something more secure such as an Otterbox or even the Zugu case if you’re accident prone or are more rough around the edges when it comes to your tech. </p><p>I also wish the stand options on the case were a bit more comfortable for viewing, though it’s a nice add to have the option to prop up my iPad up at all while watching a show or video. For the $60 price tag though, I think this a great buy for the features you are getting, especially considering a similar folio case from Apple is now around $80 and ones at Casetify start at $92. </p><p>Current customers on the Burga website said they like the overall value of the case, with emphasis on the case’s design, build, and and quality. Many said they enjoyed the fun patterns and color options – which outdo most other case mentioned on this list in the color department, and compete with the likes of only Casetify. </p><p><strong>Burga iPad Pro Case features:</strong> Raised bezel design for camera and screen protection | Apple Pencil storage and charging spot | Variety of colors and styles | Shock absorbing bumper | Stand configurations | Never-fading prints </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/159047/499820/8585?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-pro.html?sp=1&searchclick=logi&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Logitech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Combo-Touch-iPad-12-9-inch/dp/B0938C32PZ?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cce86bddd-f4f6-46fc-b880-c548cacb1f44%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Combo-Touch-iPad-11-inch/dp/B0937Z63SR?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cce86bddd-f4f6-46fc-b880-c548cacb1f44%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Detachable keyboard</li><li>Trackpad</li><li>Stylus storage</li><li>Backlit keys</li><li>More affordable than Apple’s Magic Keyboard</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Slightly heavy</li><li>Still pricey</li><li>Limited color options</li></ul><h2 id="Logitech-Combo-Touch-Keyboard-Case"><a href="#Logitech-Combo-Touch-Keyboard-Case" class="headerlink" title="Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Case"></a>Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Case</h2><h3 id="Best-iPad-Pro-keyboard-case"><a href="#Best-iPad-Pro-keyboard-case" class="headerlink" title="Best iPad Pro keyboard case"></a>Best iPad Pro keyboard case</h3><p>The Logitech Combo Touch is our pick for the best overall iPad Pro keyboard case thanks to its top features and affordable price.

It offers four modes of use (type, view, sketch, and read) to suit iany of your iPad activities. </p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-combo-touch-crayon-review/" >My favorite iPad keyboard and stylus are not made by Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>When ZDNET’s Senior Reviews Editor Kerry Wan tested the Combo Touch and Logitech Crayon Stylus with the iPad 10th Gen back in 2022, he lauded its ability to “flex on the Magic Keyboard [Folio].” </p><p>“Logitech’s Combo Touch cover and Crayon stylus for the iPad are cheaper and practically better than Apple’s own accessories. [They] are not perfect, but they deliver a more feature-rich experience than Apple’s first-party accessories at a fraction of the cost. That’s not a knock on Apple’s own iPad keyboard and stylus by any means; the two are just as worthy of your consideration,” Wan wrote in <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-combo-touch-crayon-review/" >his review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Current customers on the Logitech website said they liked the top of the line features, overall value, and price point of the Combo Touch case, which has over 100 5&#x2F;5 star reviews. One customer, like Wan, even said it beat out Apple’s own Magic Keyboard. “This product is exactly what I hoped Apple was going to provide. And, it was at a fraction of the price,” they wrote. </p><p><strong>Logitech Combo Touch</strong> <strong>features</strong>: 4 modes (type, view, sketch, read) | Detachable keyboard | Backlit keys | Stylus storage | Full row of iPad OS shortcut keys | 1-year limited warranty | Two viewing angles</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/otterbox-defender-series-pro-for-apple-ipad-pro-12-9-6th-gen-5th-gen-4th-gen-and-3rd-gen-black/6453122.p?skuId=6453122&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/protective-ipad-pro-11-inch-m4-case-black/77-95237.html" >View now at Otterbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/protective-ipad-pro-13-inch-m4-case-black/77-95232.html" >View now at Otterbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Durability</li><li>Edge protection</li><li>Port covers</li><li>Excellent protection against dirt and grime</li><li>Rugged build</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>No color options</li><li>A bit bulky</li></ul><h2 id="OtterBox-Defender"><a href="#OtterBox-Defender" class="headerlink" title="OtterBox Defender"></a>OtterBox Defender</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137221/26400" target="_top" id="2137221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137221/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-iPad-Pro-case-for-max-durability"><a href="#Best-iPad-Pro-case-for-max-durability" class="headerlink" title="Best iPad Pro case for max durability"></a>Best iPad Pro case for max durability</h3><p>Some people use their iPads to scroll on the couch, but others need a tablet in the field.

Plus, the Defender Series Pro case comes with OtterBox’s silver-based antimicrobial additive, which means your case actively fights bacteria growth.

Moft makes some of the most innovate, origami-inspired mobile and tech accessories I’ve seen. </p><p>The Moft Snap Float Folio case features a strong magnetic connection with a sleek and slim design that makes the case feel elevated and premium. The stylus holder is a plus, and the case configures into three different angled positions. One standing position is an ultra high alignment (as pictured) which lifts your iPad up above much of the competitors. </p><p>The case is a duo system, so you can customize which parts you want to use at any given time. There’s a soft outside folio and a hard case set for extra protection. They can be used individually or together, and it’s easy to change. I tested the Moft case for the last month on my iPad Air, and I especially liked the standing configuration, which allowed it to be eye-level. It’s perfect for working from home or personal video calls. I also enjoyed the premium look and feel, which is certainly more elevated than some other case options on this list. One downside right now is there is no iPad Pro 13-inch case available.</p><p>Current Moft Float Folio users said they like the overall design and quality feel of the case, as well as the functionality thanks to the unique stand configurations. One customer even said Moft cases deserved more hype than they get. “It’s the best case and holder ever. The quality of materials is great, the finishes are great. You can put it in any position you’re thinking of and your iPad is very well protected too. Simply the best. This product should be better known,” the customer wrote.</p><p><strong>Moft Snap Float Folio Case</strong> <strong>features</strong>: Stylus holder | Three unique stand configurations (one ultra high) | Premium construction and feel | Slim profile | Duo case set | Affordable luxury style </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-iPad-Pro-case"><a href="#What-is-the-best-iPad-Pro-case" class="headerlink" title="What is the best iPad Pro case?"></a>What is the best iPad Pro case?</h2><p>The best iPad Pro case overall is the Zugu iPad Pro case thanks to its great warrant, top features, and maximum protection.

Check the size of the case to ensure that it will fit your iPad model, so it won’t be too small or too large.</li><li><strong>Build:</strong> iPad cases and covers can be made out of many different materials. The best iPad Pro cases and covers incorporate durable materials like rubber and polycarbonate plastic. Some are even rated for drop protection, providing an extra level of durability and security for your device.</li><li><strong>Features</strong>: Not all cases are created equal, and they don’t all offer the same features. Consider if you will want or need a trackpad or keyboard, stylus holder, adjustable stand, or other features to help narrow down your search and make it easier to find your top contenders. You don’t want to purchase a case that doesn’t fit your wants and needs.</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> Why not add a little style to your iPad Pro? Many of the best iPad Pro cases and covers are available in a variety of different colors and patterns so you can add a splash of personality to your everyday carry, if that’s what you’re looking for.</li><li><strong>Budget:</strong> There are many affordable iPad Pro cases available, but there are also some that cost well over $100, depending on the design and features. Setting a budget for yourself can will help narrow your search parameters.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043638/7443" target="_top" id="2043638">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043638" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043638/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-iPad-Pro-cases"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-iPad-Pro-cases" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these iPad Pro cases?"></a>How did we choose these iPad Pro cases?</h2><p>We chose these iPad Pro case options after extensive research into the product category and by going hands-on with some of these products.

Apple inundated its audience with so many reveals that it’s difficult to cover everything in detail. </p><p>However, the question remains: Is it worth upgrading to the iPhone 16? Below is a short list of the three features that’ll make you eager to upgrade as soon as possible.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Camera-Control-button"><a href="#1-Camera-Control-button" class="headerlink" title="1. Camera Control button"></a>1. Camera Control button</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The iPhone 16 receives a substantial update to its camera system. The device possesses a 48MP Fusion lens capable of taking wide-angle photographs and far-away shots, thanks to its 2X telephoto option. But what really caught my attention was the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/" >Camera Control button <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The button acts as a camera shortcut of sorts. Pushing it takes a photo, but the button also supports gesture controls. Swiping on the button with your thumb or finger lets you zoom in or out, while a double light-press presents you with various shooting modes, zoom lengths, photographic styles, and more. It’s a fun and intuitive way to take photos. The best part about the button is that it’s a great way to introduce more people to photography.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135419/19272" target="_top" id="2135419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135419/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Siri-2-0-is-arriving-very-soon"><a href="#2-Siri-2-0-is-arriving-very-soon" class="headerlink" title="2.

Siri 2.0 is arriving very soon</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-new-feature-apple-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-mac-and-more-this-fall-including-ai/" >Back during WWDC 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple announced Siri would receive a much-needed upgrade. The company said Siri would gain conversational context, so it remembers what you just told it, and would soon be able to “take actions across apps”. As it turns out, the AI is obtaining exactly those features – and a whole lot more.</p><p>The new Siri can engage in more natural conversations. Users no longer need to constantly say the AI’s name over and over again to issue a command. Just saying “Siri” once is enough and you can then continue talking to the AI like you would a regular person. What’s more, Siri can understand you better – even if you make a mistake. Stuttering or mispeaking won’t ruin the input. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-will-improve-siri-in-2024-but-dont-expect-most-updates-until-2025/" >Apple Intelligence will improve SIri in 2024, but don’t expect most updates until 2025 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Everything mentioned so far is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s been reported that next year Siri will be able to find and act on items on-device based on your context. For example, you could ask the AI what time your mom’s flight is landing and Siri will pull together information from texts and emails, and then present this insight to you in a brief response.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938136">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938136">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938136%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938136/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-A-new-AI-powered-chipset"><a href="#3-A-new-AI-powered-chipset" class="headerlink" title="3.

The iPad Mini was last updated in the fall of 2021 with new features like support for the second-gen Apple Pencil, a slightly bigger screen size, and a USB-C port for charging and data transfer.</p><p>There’s a spot on the right side of the tablet to charge the Apple Pencil, making it a great tablet for drawing or writing notes. Customers who bought the iPad Mini reported in reviews that they were impressed by its battery life, durability, and display. They also noted its portability to fit in purses and bags, particularly for entertainment purposes. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-6th-generation-tablet-64-gb-8-3-mk7p3lla/"><strong>Apple iPad Mini (6th Gen.)</strong></a></p><p>ZDNET Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner tested the iPad Mini and said that it “feels more like an [oversized] smartphone than a small tablet at times.”</p><p>“It can easily slip into bags, purses, and even the pockets of some cargo pants and vests,” he wrote. “Compared to a phone, it’s better for reading ebooks, PDFs, documents, news apps, and other digital content – especially when leaning back in a chair or a couch.”</p><p>Of course, you’ll also get iPadOS 16 with features like shared tab groups, Stage Manager, and external display support if you ever need to see something on a bigger screen. Ultimately, you get all these things for less than what you would pay for an iPad Air or an iPad Pro. </p><p><strong>iPad Mini tech specs: Display</strong>: 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display | <strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic | <strong>Storage</strong>: 64GB or 256GB | <strong>Colors</strong>: Space gray, pink, purple, starlight | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 8MP rear, 1080p video. 12MP FaceTime camera with Center Stage | <strong>Weight</strong>: 0.65 pounds | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 7.69 x 5.3 x 0.25 inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: USB-C | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 10 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/dp/B096WKKK2K?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C7706d25e-bcf9-4615-bd7d-1f666ce958d8%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazon-fire-7-2022-7-tablet-with-wi-fi-16-gb-black/6508109.p?skuId=6508109&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Good battery life</li><li>Can double as an Alexa smart display</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Performance is slightly slow</li><li>Cameras aren’t as great as other options</li></ul><h2 id="Amazon-Fire-7-Tablet"><a href="#Amazon-Fire-7-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Fire 7 Tablet"></a>Amazon Fire 7 Tablet</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137220/26400" target="_top" id="2137220">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137220" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137220/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-budget-small-tablet"><a href="#Best-budget-small-tablet" class="headerlink" title="Best budget small tablet"></a>Best budget small tablet</h3><p>If you’re looking for something even smaller and cheaper than the iPad Mini, the Amazon Fire 7 tablet is a great budget tablet pick. The Fire tablet’s 7-inch screen has a 1024 x 600 display, so you can stream movies or play video games without hauling around a bulky tablet. </p><p>Former ZDNET contributor Jason Cipriani reviewed the Amazon Fire 7 tablet and said it offers “a well-rounded experience as long as you take the cost into account when setting expectations.” Even though performance may be a bit slow, Cipriani said that’s expected at a price point like $60, considering the tablet is a colorful Kindle, a dedicated Alexa smart display, and a smart home controller, all in one device.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-fire-7-2022-review/"><strong>Amazon Fire 7 (2022)</strong></a></p><p>Along with the ability to ask Alexa questions, you can view and manage your Alexa-connected smart home devices. You can control cameras, lights, and outlets using your voice or by tapping the dedicated Devices button in the bottom navigation bar. </p><p>Overall, 90% of Best Buy customers who bought the Amazon Fire 7 tablet would recommend it to a friend, giving it an average rating of 4.5 out of 5.</p><p><strong>Amazon Fire 7 tech specs: Display</strong>: 7-inch, 1024x600 display | <strong>Processor</strong>: MediaTek MT8168V&#x2F;B | <strong>Storage</strong>: 16GB or 326GB | <strong>Colors</strong>: Black, denim, or rose | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording| <strong>Weight</strong>: 9.9 ounces | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 7.11 x 4.63 x 0.38 inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: 2 USB-C, 3.5mm jack | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 10 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1773404-REG/boox%5Ftab%5Fmini%5Fc%5F7%5F8%5Fe%5Fink%5Ftablet.html/BI/23252/KBID/28790/SID/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp" >View now at B&amp;H Photo-Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Long lasting battery life</li><li>Gorgeous design and display</li><li>Great templates for taking notes</li><li>Easy reading</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Some complaints of lag</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/977686/11832" target="_top" id="977686">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-977686" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/977686/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Boox-Tab-Mini-C"><a href="#Boox-Tab-Mini-C" class="headerlink" title="Boox Tab Mini C"></a>Boox Tab Mini C</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-small-tablet-for-note-taking"><a href="#Best-small-tablet-for-note-taking" class="headerlink" title="Best small tablet for note-taking"></a>Best small tablet for note-taking</h3><p>Boox is an e-reader and drawing tablet with a vivid color display, so your e-book’s illustrations will pop as you read, and so will your color-coordinated notes. Speaking of which, the note-taking templates on the Tab Mini C are handy. Whether you’re a student taking Cornell-style notes, a desk job employee making an hourly plan for your day, a musician crafting a piece of sheet music, or a historian drafting a timeline, the Tab Mini C offers a template for that. </p><p>Another fun feature is the tablet’s four customizable refresh modes. These modes are helpful for streaming videos on YouTube and needing a smoother display or for e-reading and not minding a clunkier refresh. With adjustable warm and cool lights, you can customize your desired blue light level to tone the display before bedtime for an easier-on-the-eyes reading experience. </p><p>ZDNET editor Nina Raemont, who contributed to this article, has been using the tablet to manage her work-life calendar, build lists for grocery shopping, meeting agendas, and more. It’s become Raemont’s deskside companion and staple note-taking device.

We also looked at a tablet’s weight to ensure they were portable.</li><li><strong>Display:</strong> Small tablets shouldn’t have to compromise on an already smaller display, so we also considered display resolution.</li><li><strong>Battery life:</strong> A device’s battery life is important no matter its size, so we considered devices that can last you all day.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> Tablets vary in price range from affordable to expensive depending on brand and purpose, so we made sure to choose tablets at various price points to accommodate different budgets.</li></ul><h2 id="How-we-test-tablets"><a href="#How-we-test-tablets" class="headerlink" title="How we test tablets"></a>How we test tablets</h2><p>The ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tested in the real world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Display</strong>: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.<br>We also compare the display’s performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen’s responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer’s stylus.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet’s temperature during intensive tasks.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.</li><li><strong>Camera and audio:</strong> For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tablet testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h2 id="What-is-the-smallest-tablet-screen-size"><a href="#What-is-the-smallest-tablet-screen-size" class="headerlink" title="What is the smallest tablet screen size?"></a>What is the smallest tablet screen size?</h2><p>The smallest tablet screen size on the market is 6 to 7 inches. Anything smaller would be more similar to a smartphone.</p><p>It’s why you want to consider your primary uses when considering which small tablet is right for you. To demonstrate, if you travel often, one with a smaller screen will be perfect for carrying&#x2F;using on an airplane. If your aim is to read more e-books or draw, you’ll want one with a larger screen. </p><h2 id="What-brand-of-tablet-is-best"><a href="#What-brand-of-tablet-is-best" class="headerlink" title="What brand of tablet is best?"></a>What brand of tablet is best?</h2><p>Tablets made by Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft are the best-made tablets in terms of quality. Amazon has well-rounded tablets in its Fire lineup but with fewer performance-focused features. Boox is also proving to be an industry underdog, with impressive tablets that function as e-readers and illustrators. </p><p>Keep in mind in certain cases (Apple, Samsung), you can pair your other devices with the tablet. In the case of Apple tablets, you can log in using your Apple ID to access the same apps, pictures, and more from your phone on your iPad. </p><p>Meanwhile, with Samsung devices, you can implement Samsung Flow. Download the app on your phone and tablet. You can connect your tablet to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. </p><h2 id="Are-mini-Android-tablets-worth-it"><a href="#Are-mini-Android-tablets-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Are mini Android tablets worth it?"></a>Are mini Android tablets worth it?</h2><p>Yes, they can be.

Initially only for select iPhone models, the repair option will be available to more devices later on, though Apple did not clarify which models. The used components must be genuine Apple parts, in accordance with Apple’s efforts to minimize privacy and security concerns. </p><p>“For the last two years, teams across Apple have been innovating on product design and manufacturing to support repairs with used Apple parts that won’t compromise users’ safety, security, or privacy,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, in the announcement. “With this latest expansion to our repair program, we’re excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our customers, while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-warns-of-mercenary-spyware-attacks-against-iphone-users-should-you-be-worried/" >Apple warns of mercenary spyware attacks against iPhone users. Should you be worried? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Repairers will be able to use pre-owned parts in phone fixes after “pairing,” or vetting, whether they are genuine Apple tech. Fixed phones will then be calibrated to original factory standards to ensure security and preserve device integrity, according to Apple.</p><p>The release, somewhat unclear, seems to include biometric sensors as used parts that can be recalibrated once installed in a device, but also says future iPhone models will support reused biometric sensors. Serial numbers won’t be required when ordering parts for certain repairs from the Self Service Repair store. </p><p>The new initiative expands Apple’s repair program to encourage safe and affordable device repairs, as well as product longevity and a reduced <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-modular-android-phone-will-outlive-the-latest-iphones-and-pixels-but-theres-a-catch/" >environmental footprint <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>“At Apple, we’re always looking for new ways to deliver the best possible experience for our customers while reducing the impact we have on the planet, and a key part of that means designing products that last,” Ternus added. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-new-airpower-video-is-out-but-is-apple-actually-reviving-its-qi-wireless-charging-mat/" >A new AirPower video is out, but is Apple actually reviving its Qi wireless charging mat? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>To maintain transparency about repair history and deter disassembly of stolen phones, Apple will extend Activation Lock to iPhone parts to alert those repairing the device if the parts have been reported lost or stolen. If they are, repairers will restrict calibration. Similarly, the company will update the Parts and Service History in iOS to indicate whether a part is new or used in the iPhone’s Settings. </p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="Why I&#39;m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I&#39;m not alone)">Why I’m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-onedrive-messing-with-your-files-how-to-get-your-windows-storage-under-control/"  title="Is OneDrive messing with your files?

You may want to consider an iPhone if you find the Apple Watch compelling enough. We have a few reasons that you may want to move to iOS.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-expect-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/" >Everything to expect at Made by Google 2024: Pixel 9 Pro, Fold, Gemini, Watch 3, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Google launched the first Pixel Watch in 2022. The new Pixel Watch 3 is its best yet, with two size options that will appeal to more people. A Google Pixel smartphone is also an incredible smartphone, so if you like the sleek round design of the Pixel Watch 3 better than the square Apple Watch Series 9, you won’t be sorry with a Pixel smartphone.</p><p>To help you better decide between the two, let’s take a look at the key differences below.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Google Pixel Watch 3</strong></th><th><strong>Apple Watch Series 9</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Display</td><td>1.2-inch 320x320 AMOLED (41mm) and 1.45-inch 320x320 (45mm)</td><td>1.7-inch 430x352 OLED (41mm) and 1.9-inch 484x396 (45mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>31g (41mm) and 37g (45mm)</td><td>32g (41mm, AL) and 39 grams (45mm, AL)</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Qualcomm SW5100</td><td>Apple Silicon S9</td></tr><tr><td>RAM&#x2F;Storage</td><td>2GB&#x2F;32GB</td><td>1GB&#x2F;64GB</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>306mAh (41mm) and 420mAh (45mm)</td><td>282mAh (41mm) and 308mAh (45mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Durability</td><td>5ATM&#x2F;IP68</td><td>50m&#x2F;IP6x</td></tr><tr><td>Material</td><td>Aluminum</td><td>Aluminum and stainless steel</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>Starting at $349.99 (41mm) and $399.99 (45mm)</td><td>Starting at $399 (41mm) and $429 (45mm)</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-Google-Pixel-Watch-3-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-Google-Pixel-Watch-3-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the Google Pixel Watch 3 if…"></a>You should buy the Google Pixel Watch 3 if…</h2><p>June Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h3 id="1-The-deep-Fitbit-and-Google-integration-appeals-to-you"><a href="#1-The-deep-Fitbit-and-Google-integration-appeals-to-you" class="headerlink" title="1. The deep Fitbit and Google integration appeals to you"></a>1. The deep Fitbit and Google integration appeals to you</h3><p>Google acquired Fitbit in 2021 and has rolled the Fitbit health and wellness features into its Pixel Watch models. With each new Pixel Watch model, the Fitbit features get better. This year, new readiness and cardio load tracking guides should help you with workouts that are optimized for you and your body. Fitbit Premium should provide personalized, AI-powered run recommendations, while the new Fitbit Morning Brief should deliver a health and wellness summary when you wake up.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-google-pixel-watch-3-these-three-best-features-make-a-difference/" >I went hands-on with Google Pixel Watch 3: These three best features make a difference <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The promise of a full Google watch finally starts to become more of a reality with improved Google integration. This integration includes Nest camera and doorbell streams, Google TV remote functionality, offline Google Maps, and improved Google Assistant call handling.</p><h3 id="2-You-own-an-Android-smartphone"><a href="#2-You-own-an-Android-smartphone" class="headerlink" title="2. You own an Android smartphone"></a>2. You own an Android smartphone</h3><p>In years past, Google’s wearable operating system supported iPhone use, letting you choose from many Android-based wearables no matter which phone operating system you were using. That changed a couple of years ago, so if you want to use a Google Pixel Watch, you need to connect it to an Android smartphone.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-preorder-the-new-pixel-watch-3/" >How to preorder the new Pixel Watch 3, and the best deals so far <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You don’t need a Google Pixel phone to use a Google Pixel Watch, though, so you can pick up a fairly affordable Android smartphone if you really want to use a Pixel Watch 3.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="3-You-like-the-smooth-pebble-design"><a href="#3-You-like-the-smooth-pebble-design" class="headerlink" title="3. You like the smooth pebble design"></a>3. You like the smooth pebble design</h3><p>Although the first two Pixel Watch models were too small for my wrist, I loved the round, subtle design and am pleased to see Google continue with that same form factor. It stands apart from other watches that embrace a more traditional watch case and bezel. The smooth round watch makes it easy to wear while sleeping, which may lead to better sleep data results.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-2-should-you-upgrade/" >Google Pixel Watch 3 vs Pixel Watch 2: Should you upgrade? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The design does leave the glass display unprotected, so if you are someone who is known for knocking their wrist against walls and other objects, then the Pixel Watch 3 may not be the best option for you. If you want an elegant, simple design, however, you will love the continued Pixel Watch design language.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/?modelCode=SM-R960NZKAXAA&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >Buy the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic $429 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043596/7443" target="_top" id="2043596">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043596" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043596/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-Apple-Watch-Series-9-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-Apple-Watch-Series-9-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the Apple Watch Series 9 if…"></a>You should buy the Apple Watch Series 9 if…</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h3 id="1-Reliable-gesture-control-appeals-to-you"><a href="#1-Reliable-gesture-control-appeals-to-you" class="headerlink" title="1. Reliable gesture control appeals to you"></a>1. Reliable gesture control appeals to you</h3><p>Apple recently added gestures with the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, and unlike some other watches with gesture support, they work reliably. The one-handed quick double pinch is fantastic for checking the Smart Stack and scrolling while your other hand is carrying things or otherwise occupied.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >The best Apple Watches you can buy: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You can answer calls, view messages from a notification, capture a photo with your iPhone while using the Camera Remote app, or snooze an alarm with gestures on an Apple Watch.</p><h3 id="2-You-want-to-use-lots-of-third-party-apps"><a href="#2-You-want-to-use-lots-of-third-party-apps" class="headerlink" title="2. You want to use lots of third-party apps"></a>2. You want to use lots of third-party apps</h3><p>Google can’t beat Apple when it comes to third-party application support. In every type of app recommendation list I have made, more of the apps I regularly use are available on an Apple Watch than a Pixel Watch.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/" >Apple Watch Series 9 review: Why I’m not settling for the less expensive models in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In addition to the vast number of applications available, developers tend to launch first on the Apple Watch, so new apps usually appear on WatchOS first. Some of the applications even make the Apple Watch Series 9 function better than a smartphone did just a few years ago.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997643/19272" target="_top" id="1997643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997643/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-You-want-the-best-heart-rate-sensor-on-a-watch"><a href="#3-You-want-the-best-heart-rate-sensor-on-a-watch" class="headerlink" title="3. You want the best heart rate sensor on a watch"></a>3. You want the best heart rate sensor on a watch</h3><p>Every smartwatch today has an integrated heart rate sensor, and the Apple Watch stands proudly above them all in terms of accuracy and reliability. Rob ter Horst, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheQuantifiedScientist" >The Quantified Scientist <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, has tested a vast number of wearables. If you check out his video and charts, Apple Watch models are always at the top of the list for heart rate performance.</p><p>The heart rate sensor is key to the health and wellness features, including sleep and activity tracking. It’s nice to have an accurate heart rate sensor right on your wrist, as it means you won’t have to wear a separate heart rate strap on your arm or chest.

The most inexpensive iPhone is the iPhone SE, which starts at $429. Apple revamped the iPhone SE in 2022 with the same processor as the more expensive iPhone 13 lineup. I went hands-on with the iPhone SE, and the end result was an iPhone 13-like experience in a phone that’s half the price. </p><p>The phone features a 4.7-inch display and a Touch ID home button that your child can use to secure their iPhone with a fingerprint. The rear camera takes photos that are nearly as clear and crisp as higher-end iPhones, while the front camera provides a solid FaceTime experience. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-iphone-se-2022-review/"><strong>Apple iPhone SE: You simply can’t find a better phone at this price</strong></a></p><p>In addition to excellent hardware at a reasonable price, you’re also getting access to Screen Time parental controls, Find My, Family Sharing, and the rest of Apple’s software services. For a family that’s heavily invested in Apple products, the iPhone SE is a great starter phone for kids. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/z24y4x/phones%5Ffor%5Fa%5Fkid%5Fage%5F11parental%5Fcontrols/" >Parents on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> who purchased the iPhone SE for their child praised the parental control options and how easy the phone is to use for young kids. </p><p><strong>Apple iPhone SE tech specs: Display:</strong> 4.7-inch | <strong>Processor:</strong> Apple A15 Bionic | <strong>Memory:</strong> 4GB | <strong>Storage:</strong> 64&#x2F;128&#x2F;256GB | <strong>Rear cameras:</strong> 12MP | <strong>Front camera:</strong> 7MP FaceTime Camera | <strong>Battery:</strong> 2,018 mAh | <strong>Cost:</strong> Around $429</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/battery-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera-Indigo/dp/B09BTB5MKT/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C694b4224-85a6-4d06-a1bb-4ffcb4ffd95e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-moto-g-pure-32gb-memory-unlocked-deep-indigo/6476149.p?skuId=6476149&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Large display</li><li>Good battery</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Somewhat slow performance</li><li>Low internal storage</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027162/19272" target="_top" id="2027162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027162/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Moto-G-Pure"><a href="#Moto-G-Pure" class="headerlink" title="Moto G Pure"></a>Moto G Pure</h2><h3 id="Best-starter-phone-for-kids"><a href="#Best-starter-phone-for-kids" class="headerlink" title="Best starter phone for kids"></a>Best starter phone for kids</h3><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/moto-g-pure-brings-mediatek-processor-to-us-with-159-99-device/" >Moto G Pure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an incredibly affordable phone that offers a basic experience.

The Moto G Pure has a decent camera setup, 3.5mm headphone jack, large battery (helpful for kids who love playing games), and large display, </p><p>However, there are two potential downsides to the G Pure: Storage and speed. With 32GB of internal storage, you’ll want to add a 512GB microSD card to make room for pictures, videos, apps and games. </p><p>Performance will be slower than what you’d find on an iPhone and other phones on this list.

However, we’re not completely out of the paper trail just yet. There are still incidentals – like your work ID or certain travel passes – that you may not be able to present virtually, and places that may not accept <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-wallet-now-supports-40-more-banks-can-you-finally-pay-by-phone/" >Google Pay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple Pay, and more. Plus, a virtual wallet won’t do you any good if your phone dies. </p><p>A MagSafe wallet is a streamlined way to keep your cards (and cash) secure and attached to your <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is often in your hands nearly 24&#x2F;7.

With enough space to hold five cards (the most on this list), it indeed resembles a classic wallet and not just a cardholder. The Ezmo wallet also doubles as a phone stand, so you can watch your favorite entertainment on the go or keep your phone screen visible at your desk. The stand has adjustable viewing angles in both portrait and landscape modes.</p><p>It’s made of vegan leather and comes in four traditional color options (black, dark brown, navy blue, and dove gray). The Ezmo MagSafe wallet also features a protective lining with RFID technology to safeguard your cards’ information while preventing them from becoming demagnetized.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-magsafe-wallet-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-apple-or-anker-and-its-on-sale/"><strong>The best MagSafe wallet I’ve tested is not made by Apple or Anker</strong></a></p><p>I tested the Ezmo wallet for several weeks in my everyday activities, including my commute from New Jersey to New York City. When evaluating MagSafe wallets, I always look for easy and seamless access to my NJ Transit card, which I need to grab and put away quickly. Thanks to the notch on the front of the Ezmo wallet, I can store my transit card in the front. It’s easy to slide out, so I highly recommend choosing one with a front-notch option if you’re looking for a commuter-friendly wallet. </p><p>I also like how the Ezmo MagSafe wallet provides enough space for five cards and even folded cash. It’s perfect for holding my debit card, work badge, and other incidentals like paper train tickets. I don’t often keep my driver’s license or credit card in my phone wallet while going to work, but I like that I can do so if I need or want to for another event or activity. </p><p>The phone stand was nice, too. I enjoyed being able to prop my phone up while at the office. I even found myself using the back half of the wallet as a makeshift grip on the train, which added some extra stability. Although it’s one of the priciest options on this list, I think it’s well worth the investment due to its multi-functionality and excellent quality, especially if you use your MagSafe wallet daily. The Ezmo wallet is also available in a tracking version – the LOC8 MagSafe Finder Wallet and Stand – if you’re prone to losing things frequently. </p><p>Current users on the Journey website said they liked the slim profile, smart design, larger card capacity, and sleek material – so much so that the wallet has a 5&#x2F;5-star rating online, with one customer noting that it “does it all really well.”</p><p><strong>Journey Ezmo wallet and phone stand features:</strong> Multi-functional | RFID protection | Built-in lock to prevent card slippage | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 66 mm x 102.5 mm x 12.5 mm | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> Up to 5 cards</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=6566078&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F6566078.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSXMTP6W/ref=asc_df_B0BSXMTP6W1727348400000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0BSXMTP6W&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C30d1bbf4-bc37-4d31-9e6e-f0faf7554c93%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Lightweight</li><li>Versatile</li><li>Still easily fits in a pocket</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Comes unattached upon harsh impact</li><li>Can only hold 2 cards comfortably</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1498635">                    <video width="320" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1498635">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:200px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fancheer.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1498635%2F17326'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1498635/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Clckr-MagSafe-phone-holder-and-wallet"><a href="#Clckr-MagSafe-phone-holder-and-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Clckr MagSafe phone holder and wallet"></a>Clckr MagSafe phone holder and wallet</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115921/19272" target="_top" id="2115921">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115921" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115921/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-durability"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-durability" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe wallet for durability"></a>Best MagSafe wallet for durability</h3><p>The Clckr is the ultimate multitasker wallet and is perfect for the person who loves to run out the door with nothing else in hand. Not only is the Clckr slim and stylish in design and comes in lavender or black, but it securely stores up to two cards. </p><p>When former ZDNET associate editor Christina Darby tested the Clckr, she noted that the cardholder slot kept her cards secure but easy to access when needed. Darby said she wished it could fit just one more card, but she reported that other features compensated for this. </p><p>Coupled with this wallet’s practicality is its top-tier multi-functionality. “Without adding any extra bulk, the cardholder has a foldable strip down the middle that, when clicked into place, acts as a kickstand or phone grip. Thanks to the powerful 3500 G magnet, the grip makes it easy to transport my phone, while the kickstand makes for the perfect portable tripod,” Darby wrote. </p><p>When you want to remove the Clckr, simply lightly twist and pull, and you’ll feel the magnet tug off. This makes wireless charging a breeze, though you must remember to put the Clckr back on before leaving the house. </p><p>Current Amazon users said they liked the design, card storage, and security the Clckr provided. Still, some customers said they experienced breaking early and thought the magnet was weak. </p><p><strong>Clckr MagSafe wallet features:</strong> Multi-functional | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 0.38 x 2.44 x 3.94 inches | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> Holds two cards comfortably</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Magnetic-Magsafe-Wallet-Through/dp/B0CJVRFTSH?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C30d1bbf4-bc37-4d31-9e6e-f0faf7554c93%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>ID window</li><li>Slim design</li><li>Portrait or landscape stand</li><li>Affordable luxury</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>No cash or alternative storage space</li><li>Limited color options</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983552">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983552.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983552">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983552.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983552%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983552/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Satechi-Magnetic-Wallet-Stand"><a href="#Satechi-Magnetic-Wallet-Stand" class="headerlink" title="Satechi Magnetic Wallet Stand"></a>Satechi Magnetic Wallet Stand</h2><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-Wallet-with-an-ID-slot"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-Wallet-with-an-ID-slot" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe Wallet with an ID slot"></a>Best MagSafe Wallet with an ID slot</h3><p>The Satechi Magnetic Wallet stand combines an affordable yet premium luxury build and design with everyday functionality.

Inspired by origami, the Moft wallet can hold up to three cards and quickly flips into a stand. It’s ultra-thin, practically unseen, and unfelt while attached to your device. </p><p>The Moft wallet also features uber-strong magnets designed to stack with the brand’s other products, like its <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-battery/" >MagSafe battery pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This ensures you can keep all your favorite cards at your fingertips and still charge your phone without removing the wallet. </p><p>When I tested this wallet during my commute, I was impressed with its overall aesthetic and look – it’s super sophisticated and sleek. However, I found it challenging to remove cards, especially when using public transit, and three cards (my ID, NJ Transit card, and debit card) felt a little too snug for my liking. But for someone on the go more often (or someone who needs less card capacity), this is a winner. It comes in seven punchy colors, truly elevates your phone’s look, and ensures that you are never without a way to prop up your device. The Moft stand is a favorite at ZDNET, and editor Sabrina Ortiz regularly uses one on her phone. </p><p>I’d be remiss not to mention that while this isn’t a preferred pick for commuting, I do reach for it often while at home or doing casual errands or activities. It’s also been a great option for the pool and beach now that summer is here because of its less bulky construction, and it’s such a multifunctional add-on for anyone that my mother usurped my original test unit (I’ve been told it’s a great stand for reading recipes off your phone while cooking or baking). </p><p>Customers on the Moft website said they liked the strong magnets, premium look and feel, and card capacity of the Snap-on wallet. Some customers said the fabric within the folds did not hold up well, while others remained impressed with the wallet’s overall function. </p><p><strong>Moft Snap on Phone Stand and Wallet features:</strong> Multi-functional | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 0.8 x 2.5 x 0.24 inches <strong>Card capacity:</strong> three cards</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://casetify.hyyc7q.net/c/159047/228232/3937?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.casetify.com/product/clear-magsafe-wallet/pocket/magsafe-wallet-case?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Casetify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Numerous color and design options</li><li>Card port for easy access</li><li>Made with recycled materials</li><li>RFID technology</li><li>Lightweight</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Not multi-functional</li><li>Pricier for what you get</li><li>No front notch</li></ul><h2 id="Casetify-Snappy-Leather-MagSafe-Wallet"><a href="#Casetify-Snappy-Leather-MagSafe-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Casetify Snappy Leather MagSafe Wallet"></a>Casetify Snappy Leather MagSafe Wallet</h2><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-fun-color-or-customization"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-fun-color-or-customization" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe wallet for fun color or customization"></a>Best MagSafe wallet for fun color or customization</h3><p>Casetify offers a basic yet sleek MagSafe wallet for storing your cards with easy access. The wallet features built-in RFID technology to protect your card information, a card port on the back, and is made from 50% recycled materials. </p><p>It’s compatible with MagSafe phones and cases and has several colors and Casetify-exclusive designs. You can even customize your wallet with words, initials, or phrases. When I tested this MagSafe wallet last month, I liked the various design options and the overall simplicity. You can store up to three cards, but it wasn’t convenient for storing folded cash. I used it to hold my NJ Transit card and debit card, and I would have to check to ensure I didn’t lose any bills every time I took a card out. </p><p>The simple design is great for card storage at a festival, bar, or other event, but it didn’t work as well for my commute. Although there’s a card port on the back that helps nudge cards out, it was a bit annoying and inconvenient. I’d have to remove the wallet to access my transit card when it became tricky to take out. I much prefer having a notch on the front of the wallet when using it for commuting purposes. </p><p>Current Casetify users said they liked the wallet’s texture and overall design, along with the different designs and color options. Similarly to my experience, one customer said the wallet was perfect for specific use cases. “For certain occasions, this mag wallet has been perfect. The wallet is constructed very well and has a slot big enough for your credit card and ID,” the customer wrote. </p><p><strong>Casetify MagSafe wallet features:</strong> Protects from magnetic damage | Card port for easy access | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> two cards </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/ESR-HaloLock-MagSafe-Vegan-Leather-Wallet-Stand-Compatible-iPhone-14-14-Plus-14-Pro-14-Pro-Max-13-12-Series-Not-mini-3-Card-Holder-Brown/1597120317?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/ESR-HaloLock-Leather-Adjustable-Compatible/dp/B09K75L2L1?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C30d1bbf4-bc37-4d31-9e6e-f0faf7554c93%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Stores up to three cards</li><li>Versatile</li><li>Has more of a traditional wallet look and feel</li><li>Budget friendly</li><li>ID card slot</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Magnet could be stronger</li><li>Bulkier</li></ul><h2 id="ESR-HaloLock-wallet"><a href="#ESR-HaloLock-wallet" class="headerlink" title="ESR HaloLock wallet"></a>ESR HaloLock wallet</h2><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-a-traditional-wallet-feel"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-a-traditional-wallet-feel" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe wallet for a traditional wallet feel"></a>Best MagSafe wallet for a traditional wallet feel</h3><p>If you’re looking to stick to an old-school look and don’t need as much card storage as the Journey Ezmo wallet, the ESR HaloLock is a traditional flip-and-fold wallet that takes on what’s becoming a modern classic. It’s made with vegan leather and metallic mesh lining, and it indeed looks like you stuck a high-end, luxury wallet to the back of your phone. On the front fold, there’s a slot for one card, giving easy access to your most important card. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/esr-halolock-wallet-stand-hands-on/"><strong>ESR HaloLock Wallet Stand hands-on</strong></a></p><p>When the wallet is flipped open, two more slots have a clear window that is optimal for your ID. The HaloLock also doubles as a kickstand, adjusting to any angle from 15 to 160 degrees. </p><p>ZDNET’s Matthew Miller tested the ESR wallet in 2022 and liked its slim and stylish design. “I have had great success using it with a Peak Design Everyday Case, so it is possible to use it with a MagSafe case. The vegan leather material is supple and feels good in the hand. The stitching appears to be solid, and the stand has held up extremely well,” Miller said. </p><p>Current Amazon customers said they like the wallet’s appearance, strength, performance, and size. Many customers said the wallet holds the phone securely vertically and horizontally, and they also liked the card capacity, quality, and ease of use.</p><p><strong>ESR HaloLock wallet features:</strong> <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 4.13 x 2.6 x 0.3 inches | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> Up to three cards</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQ14RCYL/ref=asc_df_B0BQ14RCYL1727348400000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0BQ14RCYL&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C30d1bbf4-bc37-4d31-9e6e-f0faf7554c93%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/1440513763&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Two different, secure compartments make it easy to hold cash and four cards</li><li>Secure and durable</li><li>Strong magnet</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Hard to get open</li><li>A little bulky</li></ul><h2 id="Pelican-magnetic-wallet-and-card-holder"><a href="#Pelican-magnetic-wallet-and-card-holder" class="headerlink" title="Pelican magnetic wallet and card holder"></a>Pelican magnetic wallet and card holder</h2><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-keeping-items-secure"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-keeping-items-secure" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe wallet for keeping items secure"></a>Best MagSafe wallet for keeping items secure</h3><p>We get it – you’re not entirely cashless, and maybe you never will be. So, while many options on this list are excellent choices for your ID, debit card, and work badge, you will only do you good if your payment of choice is a good old Benjamin. </p><p>Rather than featuring a pocket design, the Pelican swings open on hinges – like a door – to reveal two grip-secured compartments: one is optimal for cards and the other for cash. A snap-on closure secures both compartments and closes the “door.”</p><p>When ZDNET’s Christina Darby tested the Pelican wallet, she struggled to obtain her goods. “The only downside to the clasp is that it’s almost too secure; I feel I have to pry it open to get my cards out. I’ve even broken a nail in the process.” Darby wrote. However, she said the extra security gave her peace of mind, especially in large crowds. </p><p>Darby also noted that the Pelican’s magnet is one of the strongest on any MagSafe accessory she tested, adding even more security. The main downside of the Pelican is its bulkiness compared to the other options on this list. However, according to Darby, it still fits comfortably in a back pocket. </p><p>Current Amazon users said they liked the wallet’s sleek and minimal appearance, but some customers said they have mixed opinions on its durability. </p><p><strong>Pelican magnetic wallet and card holder features:</strong> <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 3.97 x 2.79 x 0.47 inches | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> Holds up to 4 cards plus cash</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-MagSafe-wallet"><a href="#What-is-the-best-MagSafe-wallet" class="headerlink" title="What is the best MagSafe wallet?"></a>What is the best MagSafe wallet?</h2><p>If you’re looking for a MagSafe wallet that does it all, the Journey Ezmo wallet is a sure pick, and is ZDNET’s best overall thanks to its durability, versatility, and function.

We also considered the following when making our top selections, and recommend keeping these in mind when making your own final decision. </p><ul><li><strong>Practicality:</strong> These wallets aim to maximize efficiency. They all hold at least two of your most essential cards for easy access without adding too much weight or bulk to your phone, while potentially offering even more. Consider the amount of card storage you want to help narrow your search. If you’re looking for storage for less than two, try checking out the best cardholders.</li><li><strong>Versatility:</strong> When making my final selections, I considered MagSafe wallets that may not fit every card you have but can add extra functionality or use for what they lack in card space. I also thought about how well they functioned during my day-to-day activities, which included my commute from NJ to NYC. Remember how versatile (or not) you want your wallet to be. Do you care if it doubles as a stand? A battery pack? Or do you just need card storage?</li><li><strong>Durability:</strong> Your wallet is essential in your daily life, and the same rule applies when considering wallet wallets affixed to your phone. No matter which product you select, you want it to last, especially if you’re paying more than a few bucks. After extensive ZDNET testing and research, we intentionally chose wallets that will last you more than a few weeks. Be sure to consider if you’re looking to make a long-term investment for a wallet accessory or need something quick for an event, vacation, festival, or other.</li><li><strong>Budget:</strong> As always, setting a budget to help you narrow your search parameters is a good idea. If you’re looking to invest in a MagSafe wallet accessory long term, spending $45 or more would probably be worth it. If you’re only looking to use a MagSafe wallet for a few days or one event, it’s probably not worth your money to spend more than $40.</li><li><strong>Occasion</strong>: Like your phone case, any accessory you affix to your phone becomes an extension of your personality. Consider the type of design or color you’d like (especially if your wallet will become a mainstay of your cell), and consider how you’ll be using a phone wallet. Is it for everyday use? Special occasions? Events here and there? Narrowing down how you want to use your wallet can help you ultimately set a budget and decide on necessary features.</li></ul><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-MagSafe-wallets"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-MagSafe-wallets" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these MagSafe wallets?"></a>How did we choose these MagSafe wallets?</h2><p>ZDNET went hands-on with all the MagSafe wallets on this list. We spend time using these wallets on our own iPhones during daily lives to test out card storage, magnetic strength, comfort, usability, and more – not just for a day or two, but over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for a product’s add-in value. That is, can you “add-in” this product to your life and benefit from its presence?

According to ZDNET’s Jason Cipriani, who tested the discontinued leather version, it looks “identical to the original version,” with quality materials, fine stitching, and room for three cards, and it magnetically snaps on your phone the same way. This iteration of Apple’s flagship wallet is made of FineWoven material, the same being used in the brand’s FineWoven cases.
