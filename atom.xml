But how well does ChatGPT work in the kitchen? Here’s what happened when we used the AI app to teach us how to cook delicious and healthy meals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-How-to-Get-Basic-Recipes-and-Tips-on-ChatGPT"><a href="#1-How-to-Get-Basic-Recipes-and-Tips-on-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="1.

Prompts like “what’s a healthy recipe for salmon?” or “how do I make a salad that tastes good?” provide fine responses for starter recipes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B300x600%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-300x600.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-salmon-recipe-part-1.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT salmon recipe part 1"                ></p><p> In addition, the chatbot can assist with everyday cooking questions, such as providing helpful techniques for preparing eggs in a more nutritious way upon request. With its ability to provide immediate and tailored advice, this feature offers a practical resource for anyone looking to make healthier and more informed cooking choices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-healthier-eggs-tips.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT healthier eggs tips"                ></p><p> Healthier cooking options are just a simple prompt away. If you’re already a fan of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-healthy-eating-apps/" >best healthy eating apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , such as Mealime, then ChatGPT can offer similar recipes and advice. Because you can keep asking ChatGPT to refine its answers or omit any ingredients, however, it’s a more interactive option than standard recipe collections.</p><h2 id="2-Refine-Your-Prompts-for-Personalized-ChatGPT-Recipe-Selections"><a href="#2-Refine-Your-Prompts-for-Personalized-ChatGPT-Recipe-Selections" class="headerlink" title="2.

Refine Your Prompts for Personalized ChatGPT Recipe Selections</h2><p> More specific prompts like “design a healthy breakfast with adequate protein and vegetables” or “what’s a healthy, vegetarian dinner with spices like turmeric and red pepper?” also provide appropriate recipes. Get as specific as you like with the prompts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-healthy-breakfast-options-part-2.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT healthy breakfast options part 2"                ></p><p> Don’t feel like visiting the grocery store? Note the ingredients you already have on hand and the app can (usually) find an appropriate recipe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-dinner-ideas-with-what-you-have-on-hand.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT dinner ideas with what you have on hand"                ></p><p> It can also streamline your grocery shopping process. Prompt it to “please provide a healthy grocery shopping list” or “create a shopping list for a week’s worth of lunch salads with plenty of protein.” This option is perfect for those days when you don’t have the brainpower to think about cooking.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Get-ChatGPT-to-Teach-You-Cooking-Skills-in-a-Variety-of-Ways"><a href="#3-Get-ChatGPT-to-Teach-You-Cooking-Skills-in-a-Variety-of-Ways" class="headerlink" title="3. Get ChatGPT to Teach You Cooking Skills in a Variety of Ways"></a>3. Get ChatGPT to Teach You Cooking Skills in a Variety of Ways</h2><p> Assign roles or an audience to the app to learn about cooking in the way you prefer. For instance, the prompt “come up with a fun recipe for vegetables for a five-year-old please” provides a cute recipe for Super Veggie Kabobs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-healthy-meal-for-kids-part-2-1.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT healthy meal for kids directions"                ></p><p> Meanwhile, the prompt “please provide a healthy vegetable recipe as though you are an upscale professional chef” offers a recipe for Seared Asparagus with Lemon-Herb Gremolata. With plenty of fresh herbs for flavor, it’s a delicious addition to any meal. Who knew the chatbot had such elegant taste?</p><p> In other words, use your prompts to find recipes that suit your needs and interests. Tailor them to your family’s nutritional needs, or try out different types of cuisine from around the world.</p><h2 id="Does-ChatGPT-Provide-Useful-Nutritional-Information"><a href="#Does-ChatGPT-Provide-Useful-Nutritional-Information" class="headerlink" title="Does ChatGPT Provide Useful Nutritional Information?"></a>Does ChatGPT Provide Useful Nutritional Information?</h2><p> ChatGPT is (admirably) cautious about offering nutritional information. When prompted to provide nutritional information for the seared asparagus recipe, it responded: “As an AI language model, I am not able to provide exact nutritional information for recipes.”</p><p> Although it didn’t provide a comprehensive breakdown of the dish’s nutritional value, it did give some insight into the vitamins that are present in the food and their advantages. This information can be useful when you’re looking to make more informed choices about what you’re eating, but the app doesn’t attempt to oversell anything.</p><p> You can drill down further with a prompt like “Pretend you are a professional nutritionist. What should I know about eating healthily?” Then, the chatbot will offer general information about eating a variety of fruits and vegetables and staying hydrated. These basic principles of healthy eating are helpful guidelines; however, it is worth noting that your own dietary needs and requirements may vary depending on factors such as age, sex, physical activity level, and underlying health conditions.</p><p> When asked to reveal sources for its nutritional information, the app refers to “dietary guidelines and recommendations from reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the American Heart Association (AHA),” as well as “peer-reviewed scientific literature on nutrition, health, and wellness from reputable journals and research institutions.”</p><p> It also offers the caveat that nutritional science is still evolving and recommends consulting with a registered dietitian or healthcare professional for more personalized information.

While the exact number of recipes it has available is difficult to pin down, the chatbot’s endlessly adjustable recipe options will help you create fantastic meals for quite some time. Because it’s so easy to use—and fantastically free from advertisements or off-topic ramblings—ChatGPT is an excellent resource for online recipes and cooking advice.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

With the latest capabilities of Bing + AI, Microsoft has made Edge even more potent with new AI features and an updated look.</p><p> Once you’ve configured the Microsoft Edge on your device, you can directly engage with its AI capabilities, including two core features,<strong>Chat</strong> and<strong>Compose</strong> , that will be integrated into a new version of the Edge sidebar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bing-ai-compose-new.jpg"                      alt="compose text with Bing AI"                ></p><p><code>Image Credit:[ Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/)</code></p><p> Building on the content-generation capabilities of ChatGPT,<strong>Compose</strong> within Microsoft Edge will let you generate content that customizes to the required tone, format, and length.

The idea was to open up ChatGPT’s immense capabilities to third-party developers, who would then innovate and build even more powerful tools by leveraging the AI chatbot.</p><p> However, several months along the line, the launch of ChatGPT plugins hasn’t really had the impact observers believed it would. Instead, poorly built plugins that aren’t extending the chatbot’s capabilities in any meaningful way litter the store. Have an important task at hand? Skip these ChatGPT plugins that make big promises but come up short on delivery.</p><p> On March 19, 2024,<a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8988022-winding-down-the-chatgpt-plugins-beta" >OpenAI disabled ChatGPT Plugin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> conversations and completely removed them on April 9, 2024.

If you’re ever curious about what it does and go poking around—you’re probably already wasting your time because the plugin does absolutely nothing. And this is not an exaggeration.</p><p> To trigger the plugin, you’re supposed to activate it, and then include the text “I am rich” in your prompt. What happens when you do this? Well, ChatGPT is supposed to load an image of a crystal with a glow around it. What purpose does the image serve? Unless you value it as “artwork,” there’s really nothing else it does.</p><p> Years ago, there was an app on the Apple Store that cost around $999.99 which did the same thing. Once you installed the app, the only thing it did was show you the image. The only value it offered was showing people that you were rich enough to afford it.</p><p> The app was swiftly taken off the Apple Store after several bad reviews. Was this plugin developed by the same person? We are not sure. But it sure has the same function—absolutely nothing.</p><h2 id="2-Aaron-Web-Browser"><a href="#2-Aaron-Web-Browser" class="headerlink" title="2. Aaron Web Browser"></a>2.

One would think that the description accurately captures the plugin’s capabilities, but upon closer inspection, it’s not entirely true. We tried to scrape data from 20 different URLs and only one went through.</p><p> For a plugin that advertises itself as a web crawler, the failure rates were extremely high. In fairness, we tried other web scrapper plugins available on the ChatGPT plugin store, and they weren’t particularly better at their job either.

It’s relatively easy to use, and you can deploy fully functional mobile apps in a very short time without having to write a single line of code.</p><p> Considering such a reputation, when AppyPie’s plugin popped up in the ChatGPT plugins store, it seemed like you’d be able to build apps on demand by simply describing what you want in plain language. Just type in a prompt describing the kind of app you want and have the plugin build it immediately.</p><p> The plugin itself is self-described as a “text-to-app” plugin, which sort of fits our expectations. Unfortunately, AppyPie’s ChatGPT plugin is anything but that. Irrespective of how detailed or shallow you get with your description, it simply tells you the app is ready, presents a link to customize the app and that’s about all you get.</p><p> The link leads to the AppyPie website, but there’s actually no app waiting to be customized. You’ll end up being prompted to register and subscribe to its no-code app-building platform. It’s an annoying attempt at advertisement.</p><p> Sure, it seems a bit unreasonable to expect a working text-to-app plugin that can spit out apps on demand. But in an era where chatbots can write code and where text-to-image and text-to-video are a thing, text-to-app is not that ridiculous of an expectation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-AI-Agents"><a href="#4-AI-Agents" class="headerlink" title="4.

The plugin self-describes as a plugin to help you “unleash the power of multiple AIs.” The idea is to take a complex goal, break it into subtasks, and then leverage the power of multiple AI agents specializing in each subtask to achieve the big goal you set for it.</p><p> It, at least in theory, is supposed to be able to do something akin to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-auto-gpt-how-differ-from-chatgpt/" >what AutoGPT does <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Unfortunately, irrespective of the complexity of the task we set for it, the plugin couldn’t deliver anything.</p><p> It seems it was just applying a few prompt tricks and returning a not-so-enhanced copy of what ChatGPT would provide. There’s really no sense of AI agents at work.

Although the plugin is not a dud (it actually makes movie recommendations), you’re better off using ChatGPT without the plugin.</p><p> Once you’ve provided a description of the kind of movie you want, the plugin only ever recommends movies that are available on Amazon’s Prime streaming service. If you have a niche taste in movies, you’ll find the recommendations to be mediocre at best.</p><p> For quality movie suggestions, you’re better off prompting the base ChatGPT model directly<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-movie-shows-recommendations/" >to decide what to watch next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

In theory, these abilities should be relatively easy to pull off, considering ChatGPT on its own is already an impressive conversational coding tool.</p><p> However, when we tasked the plugin with creating a simple portfolio website, the result was underwhelming.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT’s-Plugin-Store-Quantity-Over-Quality"><a href="#ChatGPT’s-Plugin-Store-Quantity-Over-Quality" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT’s Plugin Store: Quantity Over Quality?"></a>ChatGPT’s Plugin Store: Quantity Over Quality?</h2><p> Rather than hastening progress, the “quantity over quality” trajectory that the ChatGPT plugin store seems to be towing is promoting lacklustre plugins that clutter the store. These plugins divert attention from other more promising tools that could truly push ChatGPT to new heights. Nonetheless, we hope that as the plugin store matures, higher-quality offerings will surface.</p><p> Once developers dig deeper into ChatGPT’s capabilities and innovate at its edges, we may finally see plugins that unlock the AI’s full power. But for now, relying on the base ChatGPT model or proven third-party tools is a better bet for most tasks. Our verdict? The ChatGPT plugin gold rush has yet to strike gold.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

I’m happy to tell you that if you want to use ChatGPT only on mobile, it works splendidly. In fact, it’s probably going to become your preferred method of using ChatGPT. At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, using ChatGPT on mobile is probably the best way to use the AI chatbot.</p><p> It feels fast, slick, and like it was designed with a mobile-first mindset. If you have used the iOS version of ChatGPT, then you already know what to expect. Just as it felt right at home in Apple’s ecosystem, so too does it feel at home on Android. And because navigating and learning the in’s and out’s of the app only takes a few moments, you’ll be asking questions and getting AI-generated answers in no time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633281&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/2_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Monthly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/chatgpt-android-overview.png"                      alt="Different screens of ChatGPT"                ></p><p> Do keep in mind that, as of July 2023, not every feature is available on Android.

However, the ability to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated content is becoming a prominent issue.</p><p> To address this issue, tools like ZeroGPT have emerged. These are designed to differentiate between AI and human-generated content. But do they work?</p><p> Let’s take a closer look at AI detection tools and see whether they can tell the difference between human and AI-generated text.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Testing-AI-Detection-Tools"><a href="#Testing-AI-Detection-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Testing AI-Detection Tools"></a>Testing AI-Detection Tools</h2><p> They say that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. So, let’s try some tests and see just how effective these tools are. It is impossible to test every tool, so we’re testing one of the most popular tools—ZeroGPT.</p><p> For material, we thought it would be quite fun to give ChatGPT a crack at writing an intro for this article and then comparing it against the “human-generated” intro:</p><h3 id="Test-One-Comparing-a-Human-and-AI-Generated-Article-Intro"><a href="#Test-One-Comparing-a-Human-and-AI-Generated-Article-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Test One: Comparing a Human and AI-Generated Article Intro"></a>Test One: Comparing a Human and AI-Generated Article Intro</h3><p> The first thing we did was get ChatGPT to generate an introduction.

Overall, ZeroGPT failed in this round. It did determine that at least part of the AI-generated introduction was suspect but failed to highlight specific issues.</p><h3 id="Test-Two-The-False-Positive-Problem"><a href="#Test-Two-The-False-Positive-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Test Two: The False Positive Problem"></a>Test Two: The False Positive Problem</h3><p> As the use of ChatGPT and other AI tools grows, the likelihood of knowing or hearing about someone being confronted by claims that their work was AI-generated increases. These accusations are one of the more serious problems with ChatGPT and AI-detection tools like ZeroGPT, as this kind of error can damage reputations and affect livelihoods.</p><p> False positives occur when human-generated content is incorrectly flagged as being the work of AI. As the example below shows, the problem is easily replicated. I am a keen angler, so I decided to write an intro to an imaginary article about fishing in Florida. I then let ZeroGPT analyze the text—it flagged that the text was 100% AI-generated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-of-zerogpt-false-positive-result.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ZeroGPT false positive result"                ></p><p> To be fair, I was aiming for this result. I kept the text generic and used “salesy” language. But the point that a human wrote this remains just as valid. This is not an inconvenience or something that can just be shrugged off.

This is not always necessarily “fake news,” as it can be relevant and informative, but there are<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ethical-dilemmas-in-artificial-intelligence/" >definite ethical concerns about AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> To be fair to ZeroGPT, it performed well in this test. We asked ChatGPT and Bing Chat to write news articles about several subjects, and ZeroGPT nailed it every time. The example below shows it correctly declaring a Bing Chat-generated article as being 100% AI-generated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-of-zerogpt-correctly-identifying-ai-news-article.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ZeroGPT correctly identifying AI news article"                ></p><p> The tool so consistently flagged each news article as AI-generated that we decided to test it on a dummy news article that we wrote for the purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-of-zerogpt-misidentifying-news-story.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ZeroGPT misidentifying news story"                ></p><p> It did at least identify some of the articles as human-generated, but it flagged over 70% as AI-generated. Again, we need to be fair here; this was a fairly basic re-hash of the Bing article and was hardly Pulitzer Prize quality.</p><p> But the point remains valid. This was written by a human using research found on the internet.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Aren’t-AI-Detection-Tools-Very-Good"><a href="#Why-Aren’t-AI-Detection-Tools-Very-Good" class="headerlink" title="Why Aren’t AI-Detection Tools Very Good?"></a>Why Aren’t AI-Detection Tools Very Good?</h2><p> There is no single reason behind the flaws in tools like ZeroGPT. However, one fundamental problem is the effectiveness of generative AI chatbots. These represent an incredibly powerful and rapidly evolving technology that effectively makes them a moving target for AI detection tools.</p><p> AI chatbots are continually improving the quality and “humanness” of their output, and this makes the task extremely challenging. However, regardless of the difficulties, the AI side of the equation must make a judgment call without human oversight.</p><p> Tools like ZeroGPT use AI to make their determinations. But AI doesn’t just wake up in the morning and know what to do. It has to be trained, and this is where the technical side of the equation becomes relevant.</p><p> Algorithmic and training-data biases are inevitable, considering the sheer size of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >large language models that these tools are trained on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This is not a problem that is restricted to AI-detection tools, the same biases can cause AI chatbots to generate<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/" >incorrect responses and AI hallucinations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> However, these errors manifest themselves as incorrect “AI flags” in detection tools. This is hardly ideal, but it’s a reflection of the current state of AI technology. The biases inherent in the training data can lead to false positives or false negatives.</p><p> Another factor that must be considered is what constitutes AI-generated content. If AI-generated content is simply reworded, is it human or AI-generated content? This represents another major challenge—the blurring of the lines between the two makes defining machine-created content almost impossible.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254549&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/8_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Looking-to-the-Future-of-AI-Detection"><a href="#Looking-to-the-Future-of-AI-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Looking to the Future of AI Detection"></a>Looking to the Future of AI Detection</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cyber-glasses-1938449_1280.jpg"                      alt="cyber-glasses-1938449_1280"                ></p><p> This may sound like we are knocking tools like ZeroGPT. This isn’t the case; they face massive challenges, and the technology is barely out of diapers. The rapid uptake of tools like ChatGPT has created a demand for AI detection, and the technology should be given a chance to mature and learn.</p><p> These tools can’t be expected to face the challenges posed by chatbots on their own. But they can play a valuable part in a concerted and multifaceted effort to address the challenges of AI. They represent one piece of a larger puzzle that includes ethical AI practices, human oversight, and ongoing research and development.</p><p> The challenges that these tools face are mirror images of the challenges that society faces as we grapple with the dilemmas associated with a new technological age.</p><h2 id="AI-or-Not-AI-That-Is-the-Question"><a href="#AI-or-Not-AI-That-Is-the-Question" class="headerlink" title="AI or Not AI? That Is the Question"></a>AI or Not AI? That Is the Question</h2><p> Tools like ZeroGPT are flawed, there is no doubt of that. But they aren’t worthless, and they represent an important step as we try to manage and regulate AI. Their accuracy will improve, but so will the sophistication of the AI they are trained to detect. Somewhere in the middle of this arms race, we need to find a balance that society is comfortable with.</p><p> The question—AI or not AI? Is more than just a discussion of whether something is AI-generated or not. It is indicative of the larger questions that society faces as we adapt to the brave new world of AI.</p><p> For the record, and according to ZeroGPT, 27.21% of this conclusion was AI-generated. Hmm.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Insights Into Beating the Turing Test"></a>Can Computers Pass as Humans? Insights Into Beating the Turing Test</h2><p> Is it possible for artificial intelligence to match human intelligence? It’s a tricky question involving philosophy, psychology, computer science, and every topic. Whenever there’s talk about human-level machine intelligence, the Turing Test is never too far behind.</p><p> In 2014, Internet journalists exploded in a frenzy of excitement when a London-based computer program named Eugene Goostman seemingly passed the Turing Test. In 2022 Google’s LaMDA reportedly did the same, but what happened? Did they pass the test? What do artificial intelligence advancements mean for the Turing Test?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299"                      border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-the-Turing-Test"><a href="#What-Is-the-Turing-Test" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Turing Test?"></a>What Is the Turing Test?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/turing-test-what-is-it.png"                      alt="turing-test-what-is-it"                ></p><p> Originally called “The Imitation Game,” the Turing Test was developed by Alan Turing. Despite its name, the Turing Test is not a true test—at least, not in the common sense of the word. It’s more of a thought experiment. Nevertheless, Alan Turing was a highly influential mathematician who formalized many concepts that led to the birth of computer science.</p><p> The Turing Test is a set of guidelines meant to determine whether a machine is indistinguishable from a human. It tries to answer the question, “Can machines think?” Turing believed it was possible and designed something that could be resembled as a kind of game.</p><p>Here is the standard interpretation of the Turing Test:</p><ul><li>You are interrogating two people</li><li>Person A is a machine, whereas Person B is a human.</li><li>You can only communicate with them using text.</li><li>By asking questions, determine which one is a machine and which one is a human.</li></ul><p> The standard game length for the test can range from a few minutes to several hours. The quality and content of the conversation are large factors in the duration. A fixed-duration test can also be administered; the standard duration is usually five minutes.</p><p> The conventional criteria for passing the test is subjective but, as a general understanding, requires the machine to fool at least 30% of all human interrogators. Turing predicted that any machine to do that could be “smart” enough to be labeled as a “thinking machine.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/turing-test-drawbacks-and-weaknesses.jpg"                      alt="turing-test-drawbacks-and-weaknesses"                ></p><h3 id="Drawbacks-of-the-Turing-Test"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-the-Turing-Test" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of the Turing Test"></a>Drawbacks of the Turing Test</h3><p> Although the Turing Test aims to find if machines can think, there are some drawbacks.</p><p> The main drawback to the Turing Test is that a machine being indistinguishable from a human does not necessarily indicate intelligence. In other words, does the Turing Test prove a machine’s ability to think for itself or a machine’s ability to imitate human behavior? It’s a subtle difference with huge implications. After all, a chatbot with enough lines of code could conceivably imitate human conversation without ever being truly intelligent. This brings up a subsequent question. Is external behavior enough to indicate internal thoughts?</p><p> Another major drawback to note is the lack of a control group. By definition, the Turing Test results are based on a group of interrogators, but not everyone is equal. Though Turing specifies that the criteria are only relevant to “average interrogators.” The term “average” by definition is not specific, and therefore, different interrogators will yield varied and inconsistent results.</p><p> Furthermore, the arbitrary nature of the testing criteria is an issue. Why is there a five-minute limit, and why is the fooling rate of interrogators set at 30%? Why not ten minutes and 50%? The truth is those numbers were derived from Turing’s prediction about the future state of artificial intelligence. He never meant for them to be explicit thresholds. However, for now, those numbers are good enough as a target to reach.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4610657&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/emeditor_chat_ai.png"                      border="0"                ><br>EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows.

Developed by a team of Ukranian programmers, the chatbot posed as a 13-year-old Ukranian boy and managed to convince 33% of a panel consisting of 30 human participants in a series of five-minute conversations.</p><p> Since 2014 there have been many speculations and controversies surrounding the claim. One of the main criticisms against Eugene Goostman was the deceptive lowering of Turing Test criteria. The developers claimed the computer to be a 13-year-old boy who does not natively speak English and lives far enough away from modern society to be ignorant of topics such as geography, pop culture, etc.</p><p> By framing Eugene Goostman in this context, interrogators did not have to hold the machine’s responses to a normal standard. After all, many modern chatbots can hold similar conversations. The difference with Eugene Goostman is that the narrative context surrounding the machine allowed the hiccups in conversation to be more believable.</p><h3 id="Google’s-LaMBDA"><a href="#Google’s-LaMBDA" class="headerlink" title="Google’s LaMBDA"></a>Google’s LaMBDA</h3><p> So Eugene Goostman may not have passed the Turing test, but how about Google’s LaMDA?</p><p> In 2022 a Google engineer named Blake Lemoine claimed one of the company’s artificial intelligence language models, known as<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-google-lamda-ai/" >LaMDA (Language Models for Dialogue Applications) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , had successfully passed the Turing Test. Lemoine also claimed that LaMDA was sentient. He then went public with the information, sharing the text-based interactions between him and the AI language model, after which he was placed on paid leave and eventually fired, per<a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/23/google-fires-software-engineer-who-claims-ai-chatbot-is-sentient" >The Guardian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Lemoine gave particular focus to an instance where he asked: “What does the word ‘soul’ mean to you?” Google’s LaMDA answered, “To me, the soul is a concept of the animating force behind consciousness and life itself.”</p><p> Lemoine claimed that this was LaMDA fearing its mortality. Unfortunately, this was quickly proven false, and LaMDA did not pass the Turing Test. Critics point out that in this instance, LaMDA managed to fool one participant, and the participant knew they were talking to a machine. LaMDA’s sense of its own mortality was simply a result of code designed to operate similarly to auto-correct.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Advancement-of-Computer-Intelligence"><a href="#The-Advancement-of-Computer-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="The Advancement of Computer Intelligence"></a>The Advancement of Computer Intelligence</h2><p> In recent years, artificial intelligence has seen major advancements. The public spotlight has been focused on ChatGPT since its official launch in November 2022. Furthermore,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/google-bard-first-impressions/" >Google introduced its generative AI, Bard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This is currently available to users in the UK and the United States.</p><p> Computer intelligence focuses on deep learning technologies, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, and edge computing with IoT integration. All of which have seen significant advancements in the past five years. These areas continue to evolve at an incredible rate thanks to computer intelligence being used to improve itself.</p><p> Artificial intelligence is currently used by the public globally. Millions of queries are occurring daily, so AI is certainly exposed to a vast amount of data. This will no doubt allow AI models to imitate human language and behavior. However, intelligence or sentience may require significantly further advancements to the core technologies of the AI model. There are some wondering if<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-what-dangers-does-artificial-intelligence-pose/" >AI advancement will pose any dangers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22889392&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://webstatic.nero.com/nero2015-com-wAssets/img/affiliate/media/banner728-90eng.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="ChatGPT"><a href="#ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT"></a>ChatGPT</h3><p> ChatGPT continues to grow in its various uses. There is so much buzz around this AI model in 2023, and it is easy to see why. However, although there is speculation, no official studies have been published on whether ChatGPT can pass the Turing Test.</p><p> Many industry-leading experts state that we may see the Turing Test beaten with ChatGPT-5, but there is no timeframe for the release of the next ChatGPT version as yet.</p><h2 id="The-Turing-Test-Has-Not-Been-Definitively-Passed"><a href="#The-Turing-Test-Has-Not-Been-Definitively-Passed" class="headerlink" title="The Turing Test Has Not Been Definitively Passed"></a>The Turing Test Has Not Been Definitively Passed</h2><p> Artificial intelligence continues to grow, and although there have been several claims, there is still no definitive agreed industry agreement that the Turing Test has been beaten. This is largely due to the subjective nature of what constitutes “intelligence” and the limitations of the Turing Test parameters.</p><p> The Turing Test is believed by many to only encourage human imitation rather than true thinking intelligence. In fact, other AI tests have been designed in recent years that are more sophisticated and specific. Perhaps as artificial intelligence gets better at human imitation, the only true way to measure machine intelligence is to use a different test.</p><p> The Turing Test might be iconic, but maybe it’s time that we shelve it and move on.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

ChatGPT: Analyzing Which Chatbot Takes the Lead in Intelligent Conversations</h2><p> Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has remained the dominant force in the AI chatbot space. Despite far-reaching efforts by several AI companies, no one has really been able to build a chatbot that truly challenges ChatGPT in overall response quality. Google’s Bard? Microsoft’s Bing AI? No, not really.</p><p> However, Claude AI, a chatbot built by AI startup Anthropic, shows qualities of a chatbot that can dethrone ChatGPT. A considerable number of users are already saying Claude is the better option. But is this the case? Let’s take both chatbots for a spin.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Claude-AI-Common-Sense-and-Logical-Reasoning"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Claude-AI-Common-Sense-and-Logical-Reasoning" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Claude AI: Common-Sense and Logical Reasoning"></a>ChatGPT vs. Claude AI: Common-Sense and Logical Reasoning</h2><p> There’s an intriguing contrast when working with AI chatbots. On one hand, they can whiz through complex tasks that humans may labor over for days to solve. On the other hand, they sometimes grapple with elementary problems that require just a bit of common-sense or logical reasoning. So, we tested both ChatGPT and Claude AI to see which AI chatbot was better at common sense and logical reasoning tasks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/logical-and-commonsense-problem.jpg"                      alt="logical and commonsense problem"                ></p><p> ChatGPT broke up the problem into bits and solved it on the first attempt.

Claude AI, on the other hand, seemed to understand that it was a trick question but failed to spot the most common-sense issue that you don’t bury survivors.</p><p> Instead, it over-analyzed the question and came to the conclusion that there would be “no survivors to bury” because crashing from Mars to Earth would be fatal.

But can it match ChatGPT’s creativity? Or, could it possibly surpass ChatGPT? To put both chatbots to the test, we tasked them with writing lyrics for a rap song that rhymes.</p><p> We chose a rhyming rap test because it is something a lot of language models struggle with. Most models will typically not get the rhyming right or get the rhyming right while the lyrics itself doesn’t make sense.

While the majority of users will probably never<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-programming-practical-uses/" >use a chatbot for coding <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , there are significant underlying implications for a chatbot’s abilities to write and understand code proficiently.</p><p> While chatbots are currently sophisticated, they are far from what they could actually become if and when they’re able to write code proficiently. For AI chatbots to truly evolve into powerful AI assistants that can do more than generate text, they need to be able to write code that solves problems on demand. We’ve previously discussed how important coding skills are to AI chatbots in our<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-code-interpreter/" >ChatGPT Code Interpreter explainer. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> ​​​​​​That said, we put both chatbots on two coding tasks. We asked ChatGPT and Claude AI to write functional code for a to-do list app. Starting with ChatGPT, the AI chatbot was able to deliver a functional to-do list app on the first attempt. We copy-pasted and ran it on a browser, and it worked perfectly without errors. Here’s the output on a browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/to-do-list-app-by-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="to-do list app by ChatGPT"                ></p><p> Moving on to Claude AI, the chatbot wrote clearly intelligible code. The structure and logic all seemed fine. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts, Claude AI kept missing some critical logic to make the code actually run on a browser. It’s a fail on this one.</p><p> After Claude AI failed the last test, we tried a different kind of coding task, one that was more about analyzing code and less about writing new code. We uploaded five PHP files that represent the complete backend for a website and asked both Claude AI and ChatGPT where we would need to edit in all the uploaded files to ensure we get a mail once a new user registers on the site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/claude-ai-analyzing-multiple-php-files.jpg"                      alt="Claude AI analyzing multiple PHP files"                ></p><p> Surprisingly, ChatGPT, despite seemingly having superior coding skills, failed at this despite repeated attempts. Claude AI, on the other hand, was able to analyze the code proficiently while identifying the right places that needed to be edited to achieve the desired results.</p><p> Of course, this was not an isolated case, we repeated it with several other code files, but ChatGPT stumbled and stalled on the majority of cases while Claude AI kept delivering impressive results. In terms of coding skills, the winner is not entirely straightforward.</p><p> ChatGPT is clearly significantly better at writing new code and can manage complex code with impressive proficiency. However, Claude AI is significantly better at analyzing large code bases. So, if you’re looking to write code for some new idea you have, ChatGPT is the tool to turn to. If you want to analyze or make sense of a code base with thousands of lines across several files, then we would definitely recommend Claude AI.</p><h2 id="Claude-AI-Is-a-Potent-Competitor-on-the-Block"><a href="#Claude-AI-Is-a-Potent-Competitor-on-the-Block" class="headerlink" title="Claude AI Is a Potent Competitor on the Block"></a>Claude AI Is a Potent Competitor on the Block</h2><p> Claude AI represents a potent competition for ChatGPT–one that can compete with and potentially surpass ChatGPT someday.

This could happen if you forget your login credentials or someone else tries to access your account without your permission.</p><p> If you get the “Your account has been blocked after multiple consecutive login attempts” message, then chances are this is the reason. The good news is this block is usually only temporary. To fix this issue, you can wait for a certain period, typically a few hours, before attempting to log in again. You can also try resetting your password.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Using-a-VPN"><a href="#2-Using-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="2.

You see, when they encountered a murder mystery, they only ever had to deal with the logic of a human mind and the complexities of a human heart. But what if the murder was masterminded by artificial intelligence?</p><p> With the advent of ChatGPT and other such AI models comes a series of websites and apps that level up a traditional murder mystery game. In some, you’ll be able to interact and talk with suspects for a single mystery. In others, the AI generates a new mystery every time you visit.

At the start, you’ll be given a list of facts about the murder and the players involved.</p><p> You will need to ask suspects and police officers a series of questions. Uniquely, suspects are allowed to lie to you, but they will tell more truth as you learn more facts and can counter-examine them. Each fact you discover gives you one point, which you can use for other resources in the game. All facts are automatically added to the “Discovered Facts” ledger that you can check at any time.</p><p> The points you earn are tradable for a few acts, such as checking alibis, checking records, investigating scenes, and tailing suspects. If you’re stuck at any time, you can spend points to get a clue on how you should proceed. Once you’re sure about the whodunnit, use the one-time “Solve the murder” action to see if you got it right.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12730965&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/w5/03_WBSX5_728x90_red_CTA.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Gron-Web-Retro-RPG-Game-to-Find-Clues-and-Chat-With-Suspects"><a href="#2-Gron-Web-Retro-RPG-Game-to-Find-Clues-and-Chat-With-Suspects" class="headerlink" title="2.Gron (Web): Retro RPG Game to Find Clues and Chat With Suspects"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://www.gron.games/game" >Gron <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Web): Retro RPG Game to Find Clues and Chat With Suspects</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-chatgpt-murder-mystery-online-games-play-detective-gron-town.jpg"                      alt="Gron is a retro 8-bit RPG-style online game where you unravel a murder mystery by finding evidence and clues, as well as interrogating suspects with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> Author Screenshot by Mihir Patkar - No attribution required</p><p> You already know that<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-prompts-to-develop-book-characters/" >ChatGPT can create fictional characters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to talk with or let you chat with existing famous characters once the right data is fed. Gron leverages this power to make a murder mystery game like an old-school 8-bit RPG.</p><p> You play as Detective Samuel O’Connor, called to investigate the suspicious death of Elias Harrington, one of the wealthiest men in San Francisco. You’ll need to move around in the game using the arrow keys and interact with characters or objects using the Spacebar. The game gives you no indication that a character or object is important, so it’s all about using your detective skills.</p><p> When you interact with a character, Gron automatically starts a chat window. Knowing the right prompts and asking the right questions is important. For example, we asked a character if he is the only son and got an affirmative response, but when asked if he had any siblings, he quickly replied that he misunderstood the first question and he had a sister. As you ask more questions, use the in-game diary to record responses so that you can cross-reference different testimonies to deduce who the murderer is.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4610657&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/emeditor_chat_ai.png"                      border="0"                ><br>EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows.

There’s a new daily puzzle, and lives are at stake! Mystery-o-Matic generates a new murder mystery every day using machine-learning algorithms. It uses a few base elements and then creates permutations and combinations that set up a daily mystery.</p><p> The wording on the site isn’t crystal clear, so here’s the explanation. There are three people (Alice, Eddie, and Carol), one of whom will be murdered. There are four rooms (kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom), and you’ll have to pay attention to the daily layout to see how the rooms are connected. Any character can move from one room to another in 15 minutes, but not two rooms in 15 minutes. You’ll also be told about four possible murder weapons (knife, gun, poison, rope) and where they were located. Finally, you’ll get a few statements from the three characters involved or based on what the police found.</p><p> Use the built-in investigator’s notebook to figure out who was in which room at what time and how they could have accessed a murder weapon. Once you’re sure about the solution, say who the murderer was, the weapon was, and the time of the murder. The game might get a little repetitive the longer you play it, but hey, where else would you get to solve a murder mystery daily?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=32667153&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.coolmuster.com/uploads/image/20201228/feature02.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Murdle-Web-Daily-Murder-Mystery-Logic-Puzzles"><a href="#4-Murdle-Web-Daily-Murder-Mystery-Logic-Puzzles" class="headerlink" title="4.Murdle (Web): Daily Murder Mystery Logic Puzzles"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://murdle.com/" >Murdle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Web): Daily Murder Mystery Logic Puzzles</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-chatgpt-murder-mystery-online-games-play-detective-murdle.jpg"                      alt="Murdle offers a new murder mystery everyday, generated by an AI and written by Hollywood mystery writer G.

Karber offers one new murder mystery logic puzzle daily at his website Murdle. The long-running successful website has already led to three books of murder mysteries, written by Karber and generated by “Moriarty”, a proprietary algorithm capable of planning a million murders a minute.</p><p> Murdle follows a similar system to Mystery-o-Matic, giving you three or four suspects, three or four locations, and three or four murder weapons every day. The mysteries get more difficult with each day, with Monday being the easiest and Sunday requiring the skills of Sherlock Holmes.</p><p> You play as Detective Logico and are given a series of clues and evidence, which you can use with the cross-referencing charting to match suspects, locations, and weapons. It’s best to start off with the mini-Murdle tutorial and then get to the daily puzzles.

These murder mystery apps relieve you of the burden of giving the AI base information and data and then figuring out the best prompts to have it generate a mystery. But if you’re willing to learn those skills, you can soon set up a few templates of your own and construct a custom ChatGPT mystery.</p><p> A good place to learn how to set up these prompts is Reddit. On r&#x2F;ChatGPT, you’ll find posts like creating a murder mystery with the characters of the sitcom Friends or the mystery inspired by the game Clue.

The company calls it an all-around assistant that answers trivia questions, suggests recipes, and plans trips, among other daily tasks.</p><p> Despite My AI’s simple interface, it’s a fairly sophisticated tool. You can do so much with it. Here are six reasons Snapchat’s My AI feature is more than just a cool toy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-My-AI-Runs-on-GPT-3-5"><a href="#1-My-AI-Runs-on-GPT-3-5" class="headerlink" title="1.

My AI Runs on GPT-3.5</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-and-openai-logo.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat Logo on top of Blurred OpenAI Logos"                ></p><p> Snapchat uses the same<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >large language model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (LLM) as ChatGPT. The GPT model is a powerful LLM that composes coherent paragraphs, adopts different writing styles, and uses everyday language. Its output almost seems indistinguishable from human writing.</p><p> Snapchat’s trainers also use the same datasets. You’ll notice that My AI knows the same things as ChatGPT does, especially with general knowledge questions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-recognizing-image-of-object.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat My AI Explaining the Details of an Image of an Object"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-recognizing-image-of-person.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat My AI Explaining the Elements of an Image of a Person"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> That said, these chatbots follow different restrictions. My AI generally has fewer rules than ChatGPT—it might perform a broader range of tasks.</p><h2 id="2-Conversations-Retain-the-Last-3-000-Words"><a href="#2-Conversations-Retain-the-Last-3-000-Words" class="headerlink" title="2. Conversations Retain the Last 3,000 Words"></a>2. Conversations Retain the Last 3,000 Words</h2><p> Contextual memory helps AI provide more accurate responses. Instead of taking prompts at face value, chatbots will reference relevant information in active conversations. Let’s say you’re looking for side hustles. AI-driven chatbots will also consider your skills and career background, assuming you provide them.</p><p> Of course, all platforms have limited contextual memory. But what’s impressive about My AI is that it shares the same high<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-token-limit-can-you-exceed-it/" >token limit as ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Take this conversation as an example. We asked My AI to roleplay a fictional character. It maintained the instructed persona even after receiving 2,000+ words of irrelevant information. Other platforms may have dropped prior instructions by this point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-roleplay-request.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat My AI Roleplaying as Ash Ketchum from Pokemon"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-continuing-roleplay-request.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat My AI Continuing the Roleplay Request to Portray Ash from Pokemon"                ></p><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-My-AI-Can-Pull-Real-Time-Information"><a href="#3-My-AI-Can-Pull-Real-Time-Information" class="headerlink" title="3.

Investigating Contemporary Substitutes for the Traditional Turing Challenge</h2><p> Over 70 years ago, when artificial intelligence was conceptualized, Alan Turing published a paper that described how to identify it. It was later known as the Turing test, and it has been used for decades to distinguish between a human and an AI.</p><p> However, with the introduction of advanced AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard, it’s becoming more difficult to tell if you’re talking to an AI. It begs the question; is the Turing test outdated? And if it is, what are the alternatives?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605"                      border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-the-Turing-Test-Outdated"><a href="#Is-the-Turing-Test-Outdated" class="headerlink" title="Is the Turing Test Outdated?"></a>Is the Turing Test Outdated?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/man-questions-robot-turing-test-example-feature.jpg"                      alt="man questions robot turing test example feature"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jesus Sanz&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/robot-scientist-facing-turing-test-artificial-1651840888" >Shutterstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> To determine if the Turing test is outdated, you must first<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-turing-test-ever-beaten/" >understand how it works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For an AI to pass the Turing test, it must convince a human interrogator that it’s a human. But there is a catch—the AI is evaluated alongside a human, and it must respond using text.</p><p> Think of it like this; if you’re the interrogator, and you’re asking questions to two participants online using text, but one of them is an AI model—would you tell them apart after five minutes? Keep in mind that the objective of the Turing test is not to identify the AI model based on the correct answers but to evaluate if the AI can think or behave like a human.</p><p> The problem with the Turing test approach of only identifying human-like responses is that it doesn’t consider other factors. For instance, the intelligence of the AI model or the knowledge of the interrogator. Besides that, the Turing test is limited to text only, and it’s becoming more difficult to identify an AI that generates a human voice or<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-are-deepfakes-explained/" >deepfake videos that imitate human behavior <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> However, the current AI models like ChatGPT-4 and Google Bard haven’t yet advanced to a point they can consistently pass the Turing test.

It works like the Turing test, but instead of answering questions using texts, participants are shown images and expected to answer simple questions while thinking like a human. However, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-captchas-work/" >visual Turing test is different from CAPTCHAs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since all the answers are correct—but to pass the test, the AI must process the images similarly to a human.</p><p> Beyond that, if an AI and a human are shown multiple images side by side and asked to identify realistic images, the human would have the cognitive ability to pass the test.

However, Alan Turing objected to that theory arguing that AI can still surprise humans.
