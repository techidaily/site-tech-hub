## Why the Latest IOS 17.7 Release Could Be a Wiser Choice Than Anticipating iOS 18 - Insights

![iOS 18 beta running on iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/fe9a6489866d194022d6674ad0f85677e0ac8051/2024/07/16/050e8d17-c7b8-4c0e-878b-ac038b116360/ios-18-on-iphone-15-pro.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

The iOS 18 beta running on iPhone 15 Pro.

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

iOS 18 officially rolls out today, September 16, to [many different iPhone models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/) from the [iPhone 11](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-iphone-11/) to the [iPhone 16 Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-iphone-16-pro-my-3-favorite-features-of-apples-pocket-supercomputer/). Users will receive multiple new features, from a more personalized home screen to [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-arrives-next-month-6-ai-upgrades-iphone-users-can-expect-first/) on certain models. 

When a new iOS version rolls out, Apple begins to slow down its support for the previous generation to get more people to adopt the updated software. But this time, the company is doing things differently. Alongside iOS 18 RC (Release Candidate), Apple is also launching iOS 17.7, [according to 9To5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/10/stay-on-ios-17-security-patches/).

**Also: [Every iPhone model that can be updated to Apple's iOS 18 (and which ones can't)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-cant/)**

iOS 17.7 isn't adding any extra features, although it is introducing "security patches and bug fixes." Release notes are unavailable on the [company's website](https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100) at the time of this writing, so we don't yet know exactly what the patch consists of.

iPhone owners can download iOS 17.7 with the assurance that their device's security won't be outdated or exposed to potential threats. You can [move towards iOS 18 at any time](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/). However, you may be better off installing iOS 17.7 instead. Here's why.

There's no guarantee all the apps on your device will work on iOS 18\. New systems always come with bugs, and it's usually best to wait until all the wrinkles have been ironed out. 

**Also: [The 7 best iOS 18 features that will make updating your iPhone worthwhile](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-7-best-ios-18-features-that-will-make-updating-your-iphone-worthwhile/)**

In addition, iOS 18 brings Apple's first round of [generative AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) features to mobile. The features of Apple Intelligence include writing tools, photo-editing tools, audio transcriptions, and more. Supporting devices include the [iPhone 15](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/) Pro, the [iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-max-50-photos-that-show-what-the-new-camera-system-can-do/), and every model in the iPhone 16 series.

Apple Intelligence will be a great addition to the iOS ecosystem, but generative AI tech isn't perfect. AI-enabled services can [often hallucinate and make mistakes](https://www.zdnet.com/article/openai-proposes-a-second-neural-net-to-catch-chatgpts-code-mistakes/). This issue plagues current generative AI models and bots. Apple Intelligence may go through the same process.

**Also: [Apple Intelligence arrives next month: 6 AI upgrades iPhone users can expect first](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-arrives-next-month-6-ai-upgrades-iphone-users-can-expect-first/).**

Once again, you may be better off waiting until any issues are addressed. [To install iOS 17.7](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118575), go to the Settings menu, tap the General tab, and select Software Update. The option to download the software is near the bottom. It's also recommended you back up your device to iCloud in case the process is interrupted.

It is currently not known when iOS 17.7 will roll out although it could arrive the same time as iOS 18 does. [MacRumors compiled a list](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/ios-18-release-date-every-time-zone/) of when Apple is releasing iOS 18 around the world. In the US, the new OS comes out at 10 am PST/1pm EST on September 16\. So by the time you're reading this, you may already have either patch available for download. If you don't, you'll have wait until it comes later in the week.

Just as a reminder: The iPhone 16 launches on Friday, September 20\. Owners of either iPhone 15 model can install the update at any time.
