## Diagnosing and Solving When Your Echo Device Appears Disconnected According to Alexa

Close 

 When you use Alexa to control an Echo smart speaker, your voice commands tell the Echo to play music, check the weather, answer questions, deliver news, share sports scores, control other smart devices, and more.

 While Alexa and Echo work well together, sometimes Alexa indicates that the Echo device is offline. Users can usually solve this problem quickly and easily with some troubleshooting.

 These troubleshooting steps apply to Alexa-enabled Echo devices, including the[ Echo Dot](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-dot-4149509) , Echo, Echo Plus, Echo Studio, and Echo Show.

##  Causes of Alexa Saying the Echo Is Offline 

 There are several reasons why an Echo device may appear offline, unable to respond to Alexa:

* The Alexa app on your smartphone or Echo device might be outdated,
* The Echo might not be connected to power.
* The Wi-Fi may be spotty or malfunctioning.
* The Echo might be situated too far from the router.

 Whatever the cause, some simple troubleshooting steps should get Alexa and the Echo device back in sync.

##  How to Fix It When Alexa Says the Echo Is Offline 

 Try these troubleshooting steps in the order presented here, ranging from simple fixes to more complicated problem-solving.

1. [ Make sure the Echo device is plugged in](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-amazon-echo-4153561) . Verify that the outlet has power, then make sure the Echo is correctly plugged in using its original power adapter.

![Amazon Echo Dot](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/p8K0InHd7jmJeH127Yx0SOg6S3g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/amazon-echo-dot-amzn-bx-59ecbc3daf5d3a00100c5cab.jpg)

 A solid blue light ring on an Echo signals that it has power and is listening. If it doesn't have lights, move the Echo to another outlet and try again.
2. Restart the Echo device. Either unplug and plug the speaker back in or remove and reseat the batteries. This simple troubleshooting step often works for many digital malfunctions in the tech world. Restart the Alexa-enabled device, and see if this solves the problem.
3. [ Move the Echo closer to the router](https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshooting-dropped-signals-and-spotty-connections-2378239) . Sometimes an Echo works fine, but it shows offline in the Alexa app because of a weak connection between the Echo and the modem or router. Moving the Echo closer to the modem or router boosts the Wi-Fi signal.  
 Move any electronic devices that stand between the Echo and the modem, such as TVs, radios, and microwaves. These devices can interfere with the signal.
4. [ Check the Wi-Fi connectivity](https://www.lifewire.com/check-network-connection-status-of-wireless-devices-818268) . If the Wi-Fi is down, the Echo appears offline. Check if the router is working and that its display lights are green. If there's a red light, the router has a problem.[ Restart the modem and reboot the router](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) to get the Wi-Fi back up and running.  
 If you fix a Wi-Fi issue, turn the Echo off and then back on again. The device should reconnect to the Wi-Fi network and reappear in the Alexa app as online.
5. [ Make sure your smartphone and Echo are on the same Wi-Fi network](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-echo-and-alexa-to-wi-fi-4158308) . If your smartphone and Alexa app are on different Wi-Fi networks, the Echo won't be able to respond. Make sure both are on the same network.
6. [ Update the software version on the Echo](https://www.lifewire.com/update-echo-dot-5198689) . While an Echo should receive updates automatically, an outdated software version may cause an offline issue. Check the Echo device's software version from**Device Settings** and update it if necessary.  
 To manually update Alexa on an Echo, say, "Check for software updates."
7. Restart the Alexa app on your phone. A simple software glitch may be the problem. Depending your device on operating system, swipe up on the app view or select**Exit** to close the app. Then relaunch the app to see if this solves the offline problem.
8. [ Update the Alexa app on your iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/ways-to-keep-iphone-apps-to-date-2000645) from the App Store or[ update the app on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/update-apps-on-android-7106106) from the Google Play store. If restarting and relaunching the app didn't work, an update might resolve the issue.
9. [ Uninstall and reinstall the app](https://www.lifewire.com/delete-apps-from-iphone-2000648) . If restarting and updating the Alexa app didn't help, uninstall the Alexa app on your iPhone or[ delete the app on your Android](https://www.lifewire.com/delete-apps-on-android-phone-5271421) device. Then reinstall the Alexa App from the App Store or Google Play.
10. [ Update the Wi-Fi network information](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-move-with-alexa-4690452) . Another culprit for an Echo showing as offline in the Alexa app is that you recently changed your Wi-Fi network name or password, for example, if you moved. Update this information and see if this solves the problem.
11. [ Deregister the Echo device](https://www.lifewire.com/register-an-echo-dot-5185594) . When you order an Echo device, it's registered to your Amazon account before being sent to you. If it doesn't show up in the Alexa app, deregister and re-register the device.  
 If you have a used Echo and the previous owner didn't deregister it from their Amazon account, contact Amazon support in the Alexa app. Tap**More** \>**Help & Feedback** \>**Chat with us** and ask them to deregister it.
12. [ Reset the Echo to factory settings](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-alexa-on-echo-devices-4795683) . When all else fails, and the Alexa app still doesn't show the Echo device as being online, reset the Echo to its original settings. If you choose this option, register it to your Amazon account and enter the device settings into the Alexa app again to use it.  
 You can perform this process from the Alexa app or directly on the device.
13. Consult Amazon's Alexa devices help resources. Access the searchable knowledge base for your device in the Alexa app from**More** \>**Help & Feedback** \>**Alexa Devices** . You can also ask a question in the[ Echo device community forum](https://www.amazonforum.com/s/echo-family) .
