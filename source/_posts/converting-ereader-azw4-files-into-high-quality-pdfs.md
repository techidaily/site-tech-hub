If you understand kindle books very much you may recognize the importance and necessity to **convert** **azw4 to pdf** for more convenient reading.

 You know, AZW4 format is a new format for Amazon Kindle eBooks. But maybe you don't know, in fact AZW4 is a wrapper format for PDF or MOBI eBooks with DRM added. Amazon calls this format "Print Replica", in that it presents a fixed page layout that cannot be reflowed. It's targeted specifically for textbooks, and it is only used on kindle books downloaded via the Kindle eReaders or Kindle reading apps.

So here comes our problem that if we purchased an eBook from Amazon in AZW4 format, we can't read it on other Kindle device or iPhone/iPad. This is just what I want to say in this guide. Believe me you will get your problems resolved if you met a similar situation.

Here is a brief guide. Step by step please.

### Step 1: Get the tool ready

One of the reasons that you can't read azw4 books on non-kindle devices is that most of kindle azw4 files include DRM, which prevents us to transfer, share, or copy. Besides, iPad or iPhone, Kobo, Nook, android tablets, etc, those devices support the ebook's format with EPUB or PDF, but not Kindle AZW4.

In short, **the DRM and format limitation** are our "obstacles". Here I recommend a super good tool named [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) to you as it can solve this 2 problems fastly with high quality. What's more, it also can convert azw4 to pdf mac and azw4 to epub, too.

### Step 2: Get azw4 files ready via Kindle for PC/Mac

Download books to your computer is also a preparation before the azw4 to pdf conversion. So don't worry my dear. After you get all the preparation work finished we are near to the success.

Download [Kindle for PC(V2.4.0) Kindle for Mac(V1.40)](https://www.epubor.com/kindle-drm-removal-easily-remove-kindle-drm-azw.html#P4) on your current computer, and then input your Amazon account to activate your computer. Then you will find all your purchased ebooks including your azw4 files are listed in the main interface.

### Step 3: Remove DRM from azw4 files

Run the Ultimate Converter tool. As the image below shows, all your synced kindle books (not only azw4) are listed at the left side area of this tool (under "Kindle" icon).

![remove drm from kindle azw4 file](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/remove-drm-from-kindle-azw4-files.png)

Then drag your azw4 books from the left to the right area. All the drm will be removed just with 1 click.

Certainly you can click "Add" to upload your books or drag files directly from devices to its interface.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 4: Kindle AZW4 to PDF

Click on "Decrypted" then from the output folder you will find that the drm removed azw4 book will be in PDF format. You know azw4 is a PDF format in a PDB wrapper, and usually (always?) with DRM. So it's not strange to see that after removing the drm from azw4, the drm free file will be pdf. No need to convert the format.

Sorry but this is impossible for now. If one can decrypt a rental book, then the activity is sort of "piracy". We all will be in trouble.

This method works, however, many photos are removed and words are present instead of images which throws the readers off. IF reading a textbook, the images will help students visually on what their studying, converting these azw4 files removes it. :(
