## Apple Vision Pro Equivalents: The Advancing Technology of Meta Quest Spectacles

With the release of the Apple Vision Pro, other VR headset makers are in a push to make their AR/VR experiences better in order to properly catch up. That's precisely what Meta is doing, and with the new v67 update, it's adding a few new features to improve multitasking.

 The latest Meta Quest v67 software update is here with a bunch of new changes, starting with a redesigned Home environment. The most notable improvement here is the experimental support for moving and rearranging 2D app panels. Instead of the default three-panel layout, you're able to create personalized arrangements with up to six panels, optimizing your VR workspace in whatever way you wish.

 A new "hinged" layout allows for grouping up to three panels, while the remaining panels can be placed anywhere in the virtual space. This opens up a world of possibilities, from watching videos while working out to referencing documents while browsing the web. Additionally, the update introduces a "Theater View" button that instantly expands any panel to full screen, dimming the surrounding environment for better focus.

 These updates bring the Quest headset closer to how Apple's Vision Pro works, where you can freely rearrange windows. Right now, though, with the Quest, you can't pin windows to real-world objects, and you can't make the position of objects stick through sleep mode. It's not clear if that functionality will ever come to the Quest headsets, but this is a step in the right direction.

 As a fun fact, this feature was previously teased in a marketing video by Meta. [Back when we covered that](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/after-every-quote-integration-include-a-parenthetical-citation-with-the-year-when-the-quote-was-said-eg-preparedness-is-key-the-best-way-to-predict-your-fut215/), some of you were right to point out that it was probably an unreleased feature, but it was still a weird move by Meta to show off something that wasn't released as something you could currently do with your headset. It still isn't even properly releasedâ€”Meta says it's an "experimental" feature. The v67 update is rolling out gradually to Meta Quest headsets and the Meta Quest mobile app.
