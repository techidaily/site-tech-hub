## Create Personalized Stickers Using the Power of Microsoft's Advanced AI Technology

Microsoft has offered AI image generation tools for a while, all of which are powered by OpenAI’s DALL-E technology. There’s now a new tool rolling out: Sticker Creator.

[Microsoft Designer](https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/swiftly-displace-queued-print-operations/), the web app for creating images, templates, and other designs, has a new [Sticker Creator](https://designer.microsoft.com/sticker-creator). It uses the same DALL-E image generation technology as the other image creation features in Designer and other Microsoft apps, but Sticker Creator is specifically tuned to create PNG stickers with a transparency layer.

 The stickers can be downloaded for use in messaging applications, presentations, or anything else. For example, you could make some stickers for a [Discord server group chat](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-how-to-respond-to-a-youtube-copyright-claim-best-practices/), since Discord allows you to upload any PNG image as a sticker. You could also theoretically print them as real-life stickers, but the resolution might be too low for that.

 Microsoft said in a blog post, “You can use Sticker Creator to craft stickers for logos, icons, emojis, cartoons, memes, and more. If you need some help getting started, or just want to see what the free AI sticker generator can do, you can play around with some of the standard prompts available in the app.”

 You can use the same style of prompt writing and art styles with Sticker Creator as you can with other Microsoft Designer features and DALL-E 3\. The only difference is that the final product will be tweaked to have a more visible border and a transparency layer. You could already achieve a similar effect by asking for a “sticker design” in the prompt in Microsoft Designer or other similar tools, but the Sticker Creator eliminates that step and properly cuts out the PNG for you.

 The Sticker Creator is seemingly limited to the Designer website for now, and isn’t available directly from Copilot, Windows Paint, or any of the other applications that embed Designer. That might change in the future, but for now, you have to use the website.

 You can [try out Sticker Creator](https://designer.microsoft.com/sticker-creator) from the Microsoft Designer website. You might need to log into a Microsoft account for it to work. Also, if you have image boosts available, they can be used in the Sticker Creator just like Microsoft Designer’s other features and embedded functionality.
