## Instant Access to 8 Bespoke Language Models for Now

 Custom GPTs have generated enormous buzz since their November 2023 launch; these programmable mini versions of ChatGPT can be tuned to excel at specific tasks with almost endless potential.

 However, although the hype is high, practical uses are rare—so we've identified some of the best custom GPTs you can try now.

 Links have not been provided for each custom GPT because the documents uploaded as a knowledge base contain private information. However, you can still take the title and outline and make each idea your own, with your own private information. Just be careful if you share any custom GPTs, as you may accidentally grant access to sensitive information.

## 1\. Resume and Cover Letter Creator

![Screenshot of Custom GPT Resume Maestro](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/resume-maestro.jpg)

 I built a custom GPT called "Resume Maestro." Once it receives a job post description, it immediately comes up with a resume with the right professional details included. It captures everything from names and contact details to work experience, educational history, and achievements. It also writes a cover letter that isn't just tailored to the job post but also aligns with personal experiences relevant to the job. Better still, its output is immediately available for download as a PDF or Word file, all under ten seconds.

 How did I do it? I uploaded dozens of resumes and cover letters written in the past. I also added resources on writing the perfect cover letters and resumes. This was topped off by providing links to my portfolios and uploading samples of high-performing cover letters and resumes I found online. The result? My personal resume expert that spits out resumes and cover letters akin to what I'd write.

 To get a resume and cover letter for any job, I either paste the job post description or just prompt: "Create a cover letter for \[X role\] at \[Y company\]," and the custom GPT provides optimized, downloadable results with little editing needed. This could be a game-changer for anyone applying for jobs, instantly generating tailored application documents customized to each opportunity.

 Here's a guide on[how to create your first custom GPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-create-a-gpt-to-create-a-customized-version-of-chatgpt/) if you're not sure how to.

## 2\. Translation Tool

![Screenshot of Custom GPT called Pidgin Hero](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pidgin-hero-description-card.jpg)

 In the weeks following ChatGPT's release, we tested[ChatGPT's ability to translate text compared to Google Translate](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-google-translate-which-is-better-at-translation/) . While Google's translation tool performed admirably against the massive power that is ChatGPT, it struggled with certain languages like Pidgin English, a widely spoken Creole in parts of West Africa. Although ChatGPT was better in this aspect, it also struggled as well.

 To improve translation capabilities for Pidgin, I created a custom GPT for Pidgin translation. How? I fed it dozens of expert Pidgin dictionaries and linguistic resources. After re-testing ChatGPT against Google Translate on Pidgin text, the results were striking—ChatGPT significantly outperformed Google Translate by nearly all metrics. This example highlights the power of building custom GPTs for specific translation tasks, irrespective of language. With the right training data, these customized chatbots can surpass even the best general translation tools. Fancy playing around with Pidgin?

**Try this GPT:** [Pidgin Hero](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-CcgN0HIuC-pidgin-hero) .

## 3\. Programming Project Assistant

![Custom chatgpt screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/custom-chatgpt-screenshot.jpg)

 It is no news that[ChatGPT can write code](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-programming-practical-uses/) . It could write code since the days of GPT-3.5 and has improved significantly with the arrival of GPT-4 and the GPT-4 Turbo. However, although the chatbot is quite adept at solving programming problems, it doesn't perform particularly well within the context of a single project since it has a limited context window and cannot soak up all the details of a project to provide a context-specific solution.

 You can deploy custom GPTs to solve this problem. Simply prompt the chatbot to create a specialized GPT that focuses on the programming languages used in your project, then upload your entire project files, including a detailed description of what you're trying to build. Whenever you run into a problem with the project, prompt the GPTs, and you'll get a much more precise and relevant solution than you'd get from your regular ChatGPT.

## 4\. Personal Movie Recommender

![movie recommender Custom GPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/movie-recommender-custom-gpt.jpg)

 Let's be honest, Netflix can be horrible at suggesting what to watch next. I asked classic ChatGPT to recommend some historical Korean TV shows. I wanted shows with themes of power, royalty, heroism, and war. The result was a mixed bag. Some options were strong, while others seemed randomly selected based on popularity rather than relevance.

 Of course, I built a custom K-Drama GPT by uploading several lists and reviews of the best Korean TV shows online. I also uploaded a small text file of what I love to see in Korean TV shows. When queried, this tailored GPT provided targeted drama suggestions that precisely matched my request—complex power dynamics, royal intrigue, bold heroes, and military conflicts. The difference was night and day. If historical K-dramas are your favorite genre, you can try out my K-Drama GPT.

**Try this GPT** :[K-Drama Hero](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-WhObLzfn5-k-drama-hero) .

![Custom ChatGPT game called Dungeon weaver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/custom-chatgpt-game-called-dungeon-weaver.jpg)

 Another very exciting use case for GPTs is creating games. You can bring almost any text and image-based games you can think of into reality. You can program, modify the rules, and play games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, Word Ladder, and more. We've previously created a list of simple but[interesting games you can play with ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/simple-games-you-can-play-chatgpt/) . You can spice those games up by invoking the DALL-E image creator to create scenery and characters on the go.

 We tried several RPG games with GPTs, which were impressive and immersive. Coming up with the rules can be a bit tedious, but you'll find several sites dedicated to creating prompts for RPG games on ChatGPT. A good example is[RPG Prompts](http://www.rpgprompts.com/) ; you'll find dozens of interesting RPG prompts you can use to kickstart your RPG experience on ChatGPT.

 You can also turn your game ideas into reality with a custom GPT. Thoroughly document every detail—rules, scoring, mechanics, visuals and then feed this game design to your custom GPT. It will generate a prototype for you to test and refine. You can invoke graphics using DALL-E or live data through APIs to level up. With some creativity, you can turn ChatGPT into a personalized game creator that turns your imaginative experience into playable games.

 Want to see simple RPG games in action? You can try my Dungeon Weaver GPT.

## 6\. Personal Tutor

![Custom GPT for Abstract math tutoring](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/custom-gpt-for-abstract-math-tutoring.jpg)

 Custom GPT models offer exciting new ways to accelerate learning and preparation, whether you're a student prepping for exams, a professional gearing up for interviews, or anyone looking to upskill rapidly. Leveraging GPT-4's vast context window, you can create specialized GPTs that serve as expert tutors on specific subjects. Feed them textbooks, course materials, flashcards, and other learning resources from the field you want to master.

 For example, if you have an upcoming physics exam, build a custom Physics GPT by uploading all your class notes, practice problems, textbooks, and study guides. You can then efficiently quiz the AI tutor to identify key concepts, take automatically generated practice tests, and get explanations of complex topics at your own pace.

 The same approach applies across academic and professional domains, from computer science to anything you can think of. Custom GPTs digest vast knowledge banks and personalize learning faster than individual study ever could. With the right training data, they become virtual masters of the material to accelerate your comprehension and skills. I created a GPT to brush up on my math skills based on my class notes. How good is it? You can see it for yourself.

**Try this GPT** :[Abstract Math Genius](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-wFmBbvdm0-abstract-math-genius) .

## 7\. Niche Tools for Work

![Custom GPT for Work](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/custom-gpt-for-work.jpg)

 Could custom GPTs improve your workflow or automate tasks in your job? For many roles, the answer is yes. Consider your typical work responsibilities and identify repetitive or time-consuming areas that could benefit from AI assistance.

 For example, as a graphic designer side gig, I built a custom GPT to create geometric Google-inspired logos using my client's brand colors: blue, red, yellow, and green. I trained it by uploading several examples of logos we designed in this style. Now, when prompted to create a logo for anything, the GPT generates professional logo options that meet the brand requirements. While a simple illustration, it demonstrates how tailored GPTs can replicate elements of human work.

**Try this GPT** :[Colorful Creations](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-e7klUPLGp-colorful-creations) .

 Another example I tried was building a GPT for interior design. After teaching the GPT the kind of designs I liked, prompting the GPT to provide interior design ideas based on certain parameters was quite easy. With custom GPTs, there are many angles to explore; it all boils down to what you do and how creative you get. The possibilities to leverage GPTs are vast across professions.

## Custom GPTs: Endless Possibilities for Work and Fun

 While ChatGPT provides a strong foundation, custom GPTs can take performance to new levels in specific domains. By training GPTs on niche datasets, we can create purpose-built AI assistants that excel at specific needs. The applications are vast, and we've barely scratched the surface of what could be possible.

 While Custom GPTs are still in their infancy, early examples provide a glimpse of their potential. As the technology matures, it will become an indispensable tool. With good data and clear objectives, our programmable companions can solve problems we never dreamed AI could handle. So don't just use ChatGPT as-is—start building your own custom GPTs.
