Hi,

 I purchased Epubor Vitalsource downloader. I was trying to convert a textbook into a pdf file, but it failed. There was a output file, in which there is a phrase "Please refresh your browser" with a picture of a robot on all pages. I tried many times, but all failed. Please let me know how to solve this problem.

 Thanks

[How to Read Webpage on Kindle?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/13/2016 8:00:00 PM 

Is there any ways to read webpage on Kindle? I know kindle has a built-in web brower, but I don't want to use it for its bad reading experience. So any other methods?

[Kindle registration page stuck in eternal reload loop](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/20/2021 8:38:14 AM 

I have Windows 10\. I bought Epubor Ultimate. It told me I had to install an earlier version of the Kindle App. With Epubor's assitance, it downloaded and installed Kindle version 1.24.51068\. The app works fine UNTIL I go to register it with Amazon. It just loops the login screen over and over nonstop. The reload is so fast I can't even type a single letter.

 Suggestions? This software is useless to me unless I can get to my Kindle books I've purchased.

[Full content did not download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/10/2019 11:20:24 AM 

The drm removal and file conversion was successful through the kindle 1.17 software on windows 10, however half the book's content is missing, only 143 out of 300 something pages. I tried deleting and going through the process twice, into epub and pdf, nothing works. 

[Cannot register Kindle app on desktop pc](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 8/23/2021 4:14:41 AM 

I re-installed the version 1.24... from the Epubor Ultimate app. After starting the Kindle app I went to the tools menu and brought up the registering page.The page keeps on flashing approx. every 5 seconds. It will not accept my user name or password.  
 I re-started from zero a couple more times, same thing.   
 What to do ?

[Kindle az3 files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/27/2016 6:40:15 AM 

I have been successfully decrypting Kindle files before. I recently had one az3 container file that would not decrypt and later another az3 file that did convert but was just blank white pages.

 Is there any way I can get you these files to see what might be done, if anything, to get these to decode? Others are probably seeing this too :)

I attempted to test a conversion of a Kindle eBook to PDF and of the 496 pages, only 25 pages converted and that did not include the cover. Are there limitations to the trial version? I really want to make sure this program is going to convert all pages before determine if it's worth purchasing.

[How to convert decrypted files to MOBI](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 10/20/2020 3:17:46 AM 

I've downloaded the free trial software and have decrypted an ePub file. I know it only decrpts 20% of the book, and I can preview it on a webpage.

 How do I convert it to MOBI so I can load it on my Kindle and view how the software works?

 I'm not adverse to purchasing the full version, but I'd like to see how it works first. 

 Would greatly appreciate some feedback.  

[How do I get paragraph break in convert to text?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/1/2020 8:55:02 AM 

I just purchased an annual license.

 The full version is NOT treating text the same as the full version.

 In trial version, Converting KFX book to Text maintained the paragraph breaks. The Full aversion does not -- so the book is one huge single line.

 How do I get paragraph break in convert to text? 

 FYI, as a work around, I tried converting to PDF as a work around. However, PDF adds LINE breaks (specific to the printed page) as well as Paragraph marks. But it uses the SAME control code for each, so I can't just search and replace line marks and leave paragraph marks.

 I would appreciate your help and guidance to solve this .

 Thanks.

[Using the free trial](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/28/2020 3:38:10 AM 

I wanted to try out Epubor before buying it.I started with a 300page book. I removed the DRM and then converted it to a pdf. The Pdf only has 6 pages though. Does the free trial only allow you to convert 6 pages?

[DRM from Kindle, conver not allowed either](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/26/2020 1:07:11 AM 

10th gen Kindle touch. I just tried the 1st option from you tutorial on how to remove DRM Kindle (LINK: https://epubor.com/3-ways-to-remove-drm-from-kindle-books.html). I have been using Calibre for some time. Ver 3.43.0.0\. It did "not" work. Then I saw this at the bottom of page: Update: (Due to a change in DRM) Calibre DeDRM plugins will no longer work with Kindle for PC/Mac version 1.25 or newer or with Kindle firmware 5.10.2 or newer.   
 Then this:  
 You will find that after downloading kindle books to computer via Kindle for PC 1.25, it's likely that we can't remove DRM from those books.   
 SHUCKS!   
 Does this mean that none of the three tutorials will work? 

 Thanks for a quick answer, I do not wish to try all the tutorials if they do not work.
