## Is It Worth the Upgrade?: Expert Opinions on Why You Should or Shouldn't Choose iPhone 16 - Featuring Editors

ICYMI: Apple launched the new [iPhone 16 lineup](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-new-iphone-should-you-buy/) on Monday, along with [several other new products and software developments](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-at-iphone-16-event-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-ai-more/), including [AirPods 4](https://www.zdnet.com/article/which-apple-airpods-4-model-should-you-buy-here-are-the-key-differences/), the [Apple Watch Series 10](https://www.zdnet.com/article/preorder-the-new-apple-watch-series-10-now-heres-how-plus-ways-to-save/), and new upgrades to the AirPods Pro 2 model to create [clinical-grade hearing aids](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-just-changed-hearing-aids-forever-and-the-lives-of-those-who-need-them/). 

And while you're probably expecting ZDNET's team of tech experts to say that we're all hopping on the [iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-apples-standard-iphone-16-and-didnt-envy-the-pro-models-at-all/) bandwagon thanks to flashy promises of [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-iphone-16-for-apple-intelligence/), a new [camera control button](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/), and an upgraded design, you'd be wrong. Despite many of us extensively covering the development of flagship tech (especially smartphones) over the years with a fervent passion and interest, outside of our work, we're probably a lot like you. 

**Also: [4 ways I reuse my old iPhones instead of trading them in - including with robots](https://www.zdnet.com/article/4-ways-i-reuse-my-old-iphones-instead-of-trading-them-in-including-with-robots/)**

We're always looking for [deals](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-preorder-the-new-iphone-16-and-get-one-free/) on top products, weighing the pros and cons before upgrading or buying new ones, and looking for the best long-term value in our tech. So maybe you're surprised to learn that despite covering the latest phone launches, from the [iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-apples-standard-iphone-16-and-didnt-envy-the-pro-models-at-all/) to the [Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-replaced-my-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-with-the-z-fold-6-for-a-month-and-cant-go-back/), some of us are still comfortably using our iPhone 12s, 13s, and 14s -- and aren't necessarily all in on buying a new model. 

Here are the top reasons why we are (or aren't) upgrading to the iPhone 16 in the coming months, including considerations of Apple Intelligence, camera features, and preorder or trade-in offers that are just too good to pass up.

## Here's why ZDNET editors will be upgrading to the iPhone 16

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

### 1\. The camera

Perhaps one of the most important features of any smartphone these days is the camera, so it is no surprise that camera quality is a big consideration for ZDNET editors. It probably is for you, too. The iPhone 16 lineup includes a new [Camera Control](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/) feature that works in landscape or portrait mode with a button on the side of the iPhone. In addition, you can lightly press the button to show camera functions you can choose from, such as zoom, exposure, or focal lengths, by swiping between the options. 

**Also:** [**Why the iPhone 16 Pro is Apple's biggest Pro upgrade in years, and I can't wait to buy one**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-the-iphone-16-pro-is-apples-biggest-pro-upgrade-in-years-and-i-cant-wait-to-buy-one/)

The Camera Control uses [Apple's Visual Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-adds-google-lens-like-visual-intelligence-to-the-iphone-16-camera/) to let you capture a photo of things around you, like a poster or a restaurant, then uses iPhone's AI capability to search for it to give you more information -- similar to the [Google Lens](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-lens-my-7-favorite-ways-to-use-this-amazing-image-tool/) feature found on Android phones. Unlike last year, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max both contain the same camera, it's most impressive yet. These models have a new 48MP fusion camera, an updated 48MP ultrawide camera, and the same 5x optical zoom capable 12MP telephoto camera. Users can snap 48MP macro shots and shoot 4K Dolby Vision videos at up to 120fps (including slow-mo videos), making these phones great for creators and photographers. Several ZDNET editors are ready to upgrade because of this camera alone, especially ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz, who has a great disdain for the camera on her iPhone 14\. 

**Also:** [**I want to be excited about the iPhone 16's new camera button, but can't (for now)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-want-to-be-excited-about-the-iphone-16s-new-camera-button-but-cant-for-now/)

"I have the biggest one-sided beef in the world with the iPhone 14\. I can give you material for years. Primarily because the camera is the worst thing I ever experienced on an iPhone. Even the base iPhone 16 model looks way better," Ortiz says.

### 2\. Trade-in deals and carrier offers

I told you we're really all just like you. Some ZDNET tech experts are ready to jump to the new iPhone 16 thanks to great carrier and trade-in offers on the models and are even more enthusiastic if they're ready for an upgrade. 

ZDNET contributor Ed Bott is planning to upgrade his iPhone 12 Pro Max for a new iPhone for his wife. "I am planning to upgrade because it is worth $800 as a trade-in at T-Mobile. I will give the new phone to my wife and will use her iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is a secondary phone for me. The iPhone 12 Pro Max still works great, but the trade-in value is too good to pass up," Bott says. Similarly, staff writer Allison Murray is ready for an upgrade from her iPhone 12 Pro and is content with the new base iPhone 16's offerings to make the flip. 

**Also: [iPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 13 Pro: Should you upgrade to Apple's latest model?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-vs-iphone-13-pro-should-you-upgrade-to-apples-latest-model/)**

And if you're looking to change carriers, like managing editor Alison DeNisco Rayome, some of the trade-in offers make it hard to resist. "I still have the 13, and the trade-in deals are making it worth it for me to upgrade to the 16 (plus we want to switch carriers, so even better)," she says. 

Verizon and T-Mobile have [similar offers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-preorder-the-new-iphone-16-and-get-one-free/) right now, and they're pretty sweet. At T-Mobile, new and existing customers can get a free iPhone 16 Pro with a trade-in on the Go5G Next plan, or up to $1,000 off on any iPhone 16 model. 

### 3\. For work

Okay, this one comes as no surprise. There was bound to be some of us upgrading because well, we do work in tech after all, and what better way to cover Apple's iPhones than actually owning the new model yourself? So while this may not be an applicable reason for some, for those in tech it is sometimes justifiable. 

ZDNET contributor Lance Whitney says he usually upgrades every two years but will be upgrading to the iPhone 16 Pro from a 14 Pro largely due to the larger screen, camera, and AI features, but also because of the work he specializes in. "As a writer, I always hope to be able to write about the new iPhone I buy to help justify the cost," Whitney says. Similarly, ZDNET's David Gewirtz is making the jump mostly on account of working in tech.

"I'll probably order sometime this month. \[I'm\] not at all enthused by the 16\. If it weren't for this gig, I'd probably wait to upgrade until new iOS updates won't install anymore," Gewirtz says. 

**Also: [iPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 15 Pro: Should you upgrade to the latest model?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro/)**

ZDNET's Jason Perlow is bumping up for similar reasons. "I am upgrading from my 15 Pro Max to a 16 Pro Max because I am on the iPhone Upgrade Program, and as I cover developments with Apple, it is a business expense and \[ultimately\] it's trading one loan payment for another. No other reason, although the camera improvements seem nice. I debated skipping, but there wasn't much of a downside," he says.

### 1\. The Apple Intelligence features aren't perfect

Apple's biggest flexes over the last few months have been their Apple Intelligence and AI features, [which the iPhone 16 is the guinea pig for](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-delivers-on-hardware-upgrades-but-punts-apple-intelligence-rollout/). While some of these new AI features are undeniably cool, like the new Camera Control, enhanced Siri features, and more, the features are still limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and above and rolling out only in beta over the next few weeks. 

Essentially, this is Apple's first iPhone marketed with an AI push, and like everything in tech, there's bound to be some kinks that have to be worked out. ZDNET's Kyle Kucharski just isn't on board with paying to upgrade for unpolished AI features. "The trade-in deals are tempting but as many writers have stated, the \[iPhone 16\] ultimately feels like a stepping stone. I'm betting that waiting one more year (which won't be hard given the fact that my 12 still works well) will be more impactful," he says. 

**Also: [iOS 18 update: Every iPhone model that will support Apple's new AI features (for now)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-update-every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-new-ai-features-for-now/)**

Jason Perlow is on the same page. "Let's not diminish the product for what it is: the iPhone 16 is undeniably great hardware. But unless you're using a old phone -- like my colleague [David Gewirtz's iPhone 12](https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-reasons-why-ios-18-makes-the-iphone-16-a-must-upgrade-for-me/), which is four generations behind -- you should strongly consider skipping this generation. Why? Because Apple Intelligence, while promising, is still in its infancy," Perlow wrote in one of his [recent pieces](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-16-is-undeniably-great-hardware-but-you-should-still-probably-skip-it/). 

### 2\. Not compelled enough to upgrade

As reviews editor Kyle Kucharski says, it's never a good idea to blindly update your mobile tech every year without thinking. You've got to have at least one good reason to payout for a new model when the one you have is working perfectly fine. 

**Also: [The 7 best iOS 18 features that will make updating your iPhone worthwhile](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-7-best-ios-18-features-that-will-make-updating-your-iphone-worthwhile/)**

Staff writer Maria Diaz thinks the same. "I have the iPhone 14 Pro Max and am still happy with it. It performs just as well as when I got it. I wish the camera were better (but the BlackMagic app helps a lot with this) and I would like the convenience of a USB-C port, but it's still working well enough that I don't feel compelled at all to get an iPhone 16\. I'm holding out for next year, at least," Diaz says. Kucharski is on the same page. "I still have the 12, and the bottom line: it still works fine," he says. 

### 3\. Expense and hassle

Sometimes it's the most obvious factors that influence our choices. The expense and hassle of coordinating a new phone may not be in some people's budgets just yet (literally and figuratively). I'm in this department. It would be really cool to have that shiny, beautiful, and gloriously pink iPhone 16, but my iPhone 14 Pro works completely fine (even though its battery grinds my gears), and I have no good reason to upgrade beyond wanting a pink phone. It would be an added expense on both my wallet and my time (setting up a new phone is not a one-day process; change my mind). Plus, I usually keep my phones until they crap out anyway, so an upgrade right now is just not in the cards. 

ZDNET's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes is still on the fence, but we agree on one thing. "It's a ton of money," he says.
