## Introducing a Lifesaving Feature: Google's Latest Pixel Vehicle 9, The First Android Phone to Support SOS Messaging via Satellite | Tech Insights

Google is catching up with Apple and giving its mobile phone users an important safety feature.

Earlier this year, a satellite messaging feature [started appearing on Pixel phones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/satellite-sos-is-showing-up-on-pixel-phones-how-it-can-help-you-in-an-emergency/). The ability to turn the feature on was there, but it didn't do anything when toggled.

**Also: [Your iPhone is getting this life-saving messaging feature with iOS 18 (and it's not AI)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-iphone-is-getting-this-life-saving-messaging-feature-with-ios-18-and-its-not-ai/)**

SOS messaging, which lets users send a text message without an internet or cell signal, is a big safety addition that has existed on the iOS platform [since the iPhone 14](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-the-iphone-14s-new-emergency-sos-text-via-satellite-feature/) but hasn't been available on Android.

We now know two things: In a first for Android, the emergency messaging feature will be live on the Pixel 9 series, and Skylo will power it.

Skylo has been around since 2017 and has sent more than 10 million messages over its existing satellite network. It also has just shy of 100 patent filings related to satellite communication. In addition to consumer devices, Skylo deals with connected machines in the agriculture, maritime, logistics, and mining industries. The company's [FAQ notes](https://www.skylo.tech/faq) that it doesn't own any satellites but instead leases spectrum from existing networks like VIASAT, EchoStar, Strigo, and Ligado.

In [a press release announcing the partnership](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240813059141/en/Skylo-Connectivity-Enables-New-Satellite-SOS-Feature-on-Google-Pixel-9-Series), Skylo says Pixel 9 users -- including the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold -- can connect to emergency services via satellite to get help or to share their location with contacts. 

For the [first two years](https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-xl/) on Pixel, satellite texting will be available at no extra cost. Apple debuted its satellite texting feature [with a similar](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-iphone-is-getting-this-life-saving-messaging-feature-with-ios-18-and-its-not-ai/) free period.

It was initially believed that satellite messaging would come to T-Mobile customers first, but Brian Rakowski, vice president of product management for Pixel phones, said at this week's [Made by Google event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-announced-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/) that the feature was arriving to all 9 series users regardless of carrier. 

Google has announced plans to bring the feature to the [Pixel 8](https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-pixel-8-is-the-real-star-of-its-android-lineup-andnow-its-200-off/) and the [Pixel 7](https://www.zdnet.com/article/pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-hands-on-the-start-of-googles-walled-garden/) through a software update, but it's not available for those devices yet. Currently, this feature is available only in the US, excluding Hawaii and Alaska.
