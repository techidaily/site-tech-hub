* You can set your Mac to launch Copilot at the press of a key with the built-in Shortcuts app.
* Unlike ChatGPT, Copilot lets you access GPT-4 for free.

## Install Microsoft Copilot From the Mac App Store

![Microsoft Copilot on the App Store](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/microsoft-copilot-on-the-app-store.jpg)

 If you have an Apple silicon Mac, you're in luck because you can install and run the iPad version of Microsoft Copilot on your computer. Here's how:

1. Launch the**App Store** app on your Mac from the Dock, Launchpad, or[the Applications folder in Finder](https://www.makeuseof.com/applications-folder-mac/) .
2. Search for "Copilot" to find the app listed under the**iPhone & iPad Apps** section.
3. Click**Get** next to the app's name to install it.
4. You'll find the app in your Launchpad. You can drag it to the Dock to access it quickly.

![Dragging Copilot app from Launchpad to the Dock](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dragging-copilot-app-from-launchpad-to-the-dock.jpg)

 Double-click its icon to start using Copilot right away. Jump to the**Getting Started** section below to get acquainted with the app.

### How to Launch Copilot on Mac With a Keyboard Shortcut

 If adding Copilot to the Dock isn't convenient enough, and you'd like to launch Microsoft's AI chatbot at the press of a button, you can create a custom shortcut using the Shortcuts app in macOS:

1. Launch the built-in**Shortcuts** app on your Mac. You'll see it in the Launchpad inside the**Other** folder. Alternatively,[use Spotlight search on your Mac](http://www.makeuseof.com/spotlight-search-on-mac-beginners-guide/) (**Command + Space** ) to find it.

2. Next, click the**ellipsis (...)** icon in the top-right corner of the window and choose**Show All Tones** to customize Copilot's responses.

3. You can choose from**Creative** ,**Balanced** , and**Precise** . By default, it's set to**Creative** , which gets you descriptive responses. I use the**Precise** setting as I prefer concise responses with only the facts that I need.  
![Changing tone in the Copilot app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/changing-tone-in-the-copilot-app.jpg)
4. Additionally, you can click**Sign in** in the top-left corner of the window and log in with your Microsoft account. This allows you to ask more questions and have longer conversations with the AI chatbot.

 At this point, you're all set to use Copilot on your Mac at its full potential. If you want to make further tweaks, click the**three-line** icon in the top-left corner to access the app's settings menu. Here, you can change the theme, region and language, permissions, and privacy settings for Copilot.

 You can clear your Copilot search history by heading to the app's privacy settings menu.

## The Benefits of Using Copilot Over ChatGPT

 The biggest advantage of using Microsoft's AI chatbot over OpenAI's ChatGPT offering is that you can[access GPT-4 for free](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-access-gpt-4-free/) . This means you can include images in your queries, take advantage of DALL·E 3 art generation, install third-party plugins to expand Copilot's feature set, and more.

 ChatGPT users, on the other hand, have to[pay a monthly fee for a ChatGPT Plus subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-plus-subscription-worth-it/) to access these features. Even though it's possible to[use ChatGPT on a Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-mac/) , you won't find the iPhone or iPad version of ChatGPT on the Mac App Store.

 It's also worth noting that ChatGPT doesn't let you change the tone of its responses like Copilot. All in all, if you want the best AI chatbot experience on your Mac without having to spend a penny, Microsoft Copilot is your best bet—at least for now.
