### Epilogue

If you’re a hardcore audiobook lover, on top of downloading free audiobooks from the above listed websites, you probably will shop for audiobooks from Amazon Audible website. However, the audiobooks downloaded from Audible.com are in AA and AAX formats with DRM protection. The 2 formats are Amazon proprietary and can only be played on selected devices or players. It’s indispensable to remove the DRM restriction from your purchased Audible audiobooks and convert their formats to a more widely used audio format, so that you can share your purchased audiobooks with your friends or listen to them on an MP3 player.

Here I recommend the best Audible DRM removal and converter, [**Epubor Audible Converte**r](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/), to decrypt your Audible audiobooks and convert their formats to MP3 efficiently and effortlessly.

You can download the software for free by clicking the links below. The trial version of Epubor Audible Converter can convert the first 3 minutes of an audiobook. If you want to decrypt and convert 100% contents of your Audible audiobooks, you need to upgrade Epubor Audible Converter to the paid version.
