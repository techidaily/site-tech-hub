In this article, I’ll make a list of **7 selected free audiobook websites** from where you and your children can listen to and download the best-in-class audiobooks for free.

#### [1\. Kids Learning Center/Listen](http://www.kidslearningcentre.co.uk/links.html)

#### [2\. Storynory](http://www.storynory.com/)

![Storynory](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Storynory.png)

Storynory has been giving free audio stories to the world since November 2005\. It’s a podcast and a website with audio streaming. It has been highly commended by _The Telegraph_: Storynory has grown into the largest – not to mention the best-loved – archive of free children’s audio-books on the internet. It aims for its audio stories to showcase imagination, good writing, and great narrations. It has over 600 audio stories on the site. Most of our stories are aimed at an age group around 7 to 11 years. However, it also has some nursery stories and rhymes for preschool, and some quite sophisticated stories. The site’s original stories are written in-house, and read by professional actors (including Richard Scott, Natasha Lewis, Elizabeth Donnelly).

#### [3\. Learn Out Loud](https://www.learnoutloud.com/)

![Kids-Learn-Out-Loud](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Kids-Learn-Out-Loud.png)

The LearnOutLoud website was set up in 2005 with the goal of showcasing the best audio & video learning content on the Web. The Free Audio & Video Directory features over 10,000 free audio books, courses, documentaries, lectures, interviews, speeches, and more. The Kids Audio & Video Directory offers a selection of over 2,000 educational audio and video titles for kids and teens. Here you’ll find audio books, podcasts, and free videos for kids to learn from. You need to sign up an account before downloading audiobooks from the website. All of the audio downloads are MP3 files and can be played on your iPod, iPhone, Android phone, and on any portable audio devices, tablets, or computers. 

#### [4\. Lit2Go](http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/)

![Lit2Go](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Lit2Go.png)

Lit2Go is a free online collection of stories and poems in Mp3 (audiobook) format. An abstract, citation, playing time, and word count are given for each of the passages. Many of the passages also have a related reading strategy identified. Readability levels for passages on Lit2Go are reported as Flesch-Kincaid grade levels. Each reading passage can also be downloaded as a PDF and printed for use as a read-along or as supplemental reading material for your classroom. All passages on the Lit2Go site are currently available on iTunesU.

#### [5\. Audio Literature Odyssey](http://nikolledoolin.com/alo/)

![Audio-Literature-Odyssey](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Audio-Literature-Odyssey.png)

The interface of Audio Literature Odyssey is very neat, compact, and advertisement free. The website is run by voice actor and writer Nikolle Doolin, and all the audiobooks on the website are narrated by her. She brings the pages of classic literature to life in this engaging literary podcast. The target users of Audio Literature Odyssey are primarily for students of literature and the English language. The website offers DRM-free audio books of classic literature works from a myriad of great authors such as: Jane Austen, Edith Wharton, Henry James, Emily Dickinson, Edgar Allan Poe, Shakespeare, and many more. The amount of audiobooks on the website is not so huge, but you can download the selections of audiobooks as per chapters. 

#### [6\. Loyal Books](http://www.loyalbooks.com/) 

![Loyal-Books](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Loyal-Books.png)

The homepage of the website is resourceful but tidily arranged. The star rating, title and book cover are presented for each book. Loyal Books website delivers more than 7000 free audiobooks for downloading and online listening. You can search for audiobooks by various genres or different languages. LoyalBooks provides a primarily visual browsing experience so you don't have to read tedious amounts to find listening material. The LoyalBooks.com website is also screen reader friendly making its resources accessible to people with vision disabilities. You'll always find the best collection of completely free public domain audiobooks and ebooks at Loyal Books. They also offer paid books such as Best Sellers, Kid’s Books, Oprah’s Book Club, ect. The audiobooks delivered by the website are mainly digitized by Gutenberg.org and recorded by Librivox.org.

#### [7\. AudioBook Treasury](http://www.audiobooktreasury.com/)

![AudioBook-Treasury](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/AudioBook-Treasury.png)

You can find many free audiobooks in the website. All the audiobooks are read by people from UK and North America. All the audiobooks you’ll be listening to are unabridged. Many of our free audio books are available freely in the public domain and some are in-house productions of out of copyright novels. Many of the audio books come from Librivox. You can download the audiobooks in MP3 and Kindle Edition. All the free audiobooks on the website are available for batch downloading as well as online listening.

### Epilogue

If you’re a hardcore audiobook lover, on top of downloading free audiobooks from the above listed websites, you probably will shop for audiobooks from Amazon Audible website. However, the audiobooks downloaded from Audible.com are in AA and AAX formats with DRM protection. The 2 formats are Amazon proprietary and can only be played on selected devices or players. It’s indispensable to remove the DRM restriction from your purchased Audible audiobooks and convert their formats to a more widely used audio format, so that you can share your purchased audiobooks with your friends or listen to them on an MP3 player.

Here I recommend the best Audible DRM removal and converter, [**Epubor Audible Converte**r](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/), to decrypt your Audible audiobooks and convert their formats to MP3 efficiently and effortlessly.

You can download the software for free by clicking the links below. The trial version of Epubor Audible Converter can convert the first 3 minutes of an audiobook. If you want to decrypt and convert 100% contents of your Audible audiobooks, you need to upgrade Epubor Audible Converter to the paid version.

Epubor wants you to be satisfied with our products. If, for any reason, the software you receive does not meet your expectations, you can **claim a refund within 30 days** since you place the order. So why not give it a try? You’ve got nothing to lose.
