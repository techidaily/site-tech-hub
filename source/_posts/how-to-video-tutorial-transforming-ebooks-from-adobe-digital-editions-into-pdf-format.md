 When you've purchased an eBook (involving a monetary expenditure) that can only be accessed through Adobe Digital Editions, you might wonder if it's feasible to convert Adobe Digital Editions to pdf--the world's oldest but the most popular one.

The answer to this question is a resounding "Yes," of course. However, before undertaking the conversion process, it's essential to understand that Adobe Digital Editions employs a proprietary Adobe Adept DRM scheme (commonly referred to as Adobe DRM). Consequently, ebooks protected by Adobe DRM can exclusively be accessed using apps or eReaders that support Adobe DRM. Moreover, these files cannot be copied or transferred to other locations due to the DRM protection in place.

Don't worry. Here I will introduce 3 methods to convert ADE to PDF.

* [Method 2: Convert Adobe to PDF Online](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Method 3: Convert ADE to PDF Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

**Pros:** It's very easy and convenient for you to operate when you are online. Those converters support many kinds of formats and they're totally free. 

**Cons:** We cannot use those programs when you are offline. That means you cannot convert Adobe Digital Editions to PDF when you cannot connect to the Internet.   
 We will be disturbed by ads that pop up from time to time.  
 Almost all of the online eBook converters don't support the DRM protected eBook titles.

Final words (epubor customer story from María Angélica Mora)

I bought a course to prepare for the GMAT, and since I don't live in the United States but in Chile, it wasn't possible for me to have the physical books sent to me (due to the shipping cost involved). The course I purchased included digital format books, and I planned to print them myself (I'm someone who needs to have things on paper to work and study better). However, it was a big problem and a great concern for me to realize that the books had to be read in Adobe Digital Editions and I couldn't print them. There wasn't much I could do because the course was already paid for. I started searching for options, and nothing worked until I found [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/). Thanks to this program, I was able to convert the files to PDF, print them, and start preparing for the test in the best possible way :)

Using Calibre, you must FIRST open the .acsm file in Adobe Digital Editions, so that the DRM-protected file is now a .pdf file in the Documents\\My Digital Editions folder. Then in Calibre you Add THAT .pdf file (NOT the .acsm file), which creates another DRM-free .pdf file in Calibre's own Library (that is, in its own folders). So you do not need to convert it. But "just to be sure", you can convert that .pdf to a another .pdf with a slightly different name.

Having several times in the past paid for drm protected e-books only to have the lose access for varying reasons; website fails, sold out or format can't be read on other device or software, etc. Removing drm and converting to other formats too is a basic and sensible precaution. I rather feel that paying out hundreds of dollars and then having those books become unusable is the real rip-off. I am also an author, but yes, there are good reasons to remove drm whenever possible, I avoid purchasing any protected books for this exact reason. Not to pirate, to protect my access to books I have legally obtained. Deal with it.
