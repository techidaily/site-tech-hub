[Kobo Glo HD Start Up Loops back to Set up](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/31/2020 1:59:48 AM 

E-reader began to fail without notice by asking for wifi credentials then showing it was attempting to sync as part of set up through the e-reader was fully functional. It then displays a message "Something went wrong...please try again". It repeats this process each time we turn it on and treat the wifi login.   
 I have done the hard re-boot by inserting the pin. I connected it to my computer - it shows it linking and uploading the books and dictionaries. When complete, i try again but the process is still the same - start up process and the indefatigable message something went wrong. No resources on-line have proven to be of any assistance.

Purchased the software yesterday 13April16 & it just locks up everytime I move a Kobo book over to remove DRM for conversion to Kindle Whitepaper. I'm using OS X El Capitan on my MacBook Air. I'm usually pretty good at figuring these things out but I'm at a loss with this one. Please advise.

[New Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/12/2020 6:38:07 PM 

 I have used Epubor from almost the start and have had no problems at all in converting and transferring books to my Kobo. Now I have bought my first Kindle, an Oasis version 10.  
 I converted my ebooks that I have on Epubor Ultimate to mobi. When I tried a trial run moving 1 mobi book to the Kindle, I cannot find it on the Kindle. When I tried to move it again to the kindle, the pop up menu said it was already on the kindle. I still cannot find it.  
 Any ideas?

[move Mobi books to kindle oasis 10th edition](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/17/2020 10:09:36 PM 

hello, I hope you are safe and well.  
 I have just bought a Kindle Oasis 10th edition ereader to use along with my Kobo Forma ereader. My Kindle app on my computer is set to the older edition that Epubor recommends and can remove DRM, convert the books to epub and then move them to my Kobo Forma easily.Using EPubor, I have converted all my Kobo books to a MOBI format but I am having problems transferring these MOBI format ebooks to my Kindle Oasis. When I try bulk transfer (say 50 books out of 950 books) some books go to the downloads folder and some go to other folders altogether. What is the easiest way to move these MOBI format books from my computer to my Kindle Oasis and have them all in the correct download folder?  
 Many thanks for your help. Please stay safe and well.
