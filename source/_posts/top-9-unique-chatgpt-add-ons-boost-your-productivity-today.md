## 1\. ChatGPT for Google

 ChatGPT is an AI tool that has proven incredibly useful. It's a language model that produces fascinating results across a variety of fields of learning and interest.

 ChatGPT for Google is a Chrome extension that integrates ChatGPT’s insights into your search results. This means that once you launch a search on your Chrome browser, you'll see responses from ChatGPT on the side.

![The ChatGPT for Google Extension in Chrome](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-showing-the-chatgpt-for-google-extension-in-chrome.jpg)

 As such, this extension helps you compare search results from both platforms. It can also be useful for comparing and detecting errors or discrepancies, as AI-generated responses are usually prone to such things.

 You can share your results from the extension by generating a link or using the**Copy** feature to export the conversation elsewhere.

 You can also set a display theme, select a language, or switch between ChatGPT’s web app and OpenAI’s API. Ultimately, if you are looking for an effective way to compare Chrome search results with ChatGPT-generated content, this extension is up your alley.
