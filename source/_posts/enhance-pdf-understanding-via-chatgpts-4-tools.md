## Understanding Why Stricter Policies Are Necessary: The Perspective of OpenAI's Chief Executor

 With the incredible success of OpenAI's chatbot tool, ChatGPT, many are excited to see what the company will do next. But OpenAI's CEO has now called for further regulation surrounding AI. So, why is this the case, what effect will it have, and is there a motive here for OpenAI?

## Why Is Sam Altman Calling for More AI Regulation?

 Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, the company behind the[ChatGPT language processing tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-ai-change-job-market/) . ChatGPT has become a worldwide sensation, but despite its success, Altman is now pushing for further AI regulation.

 On May 16, 2023, Altman appeared at a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing and urged members of Congress to continue regulating AI. Speaking at the hearing, the OpenAI CEO stated that "regulation of AI is essential" and that "regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models."

 Altman also suggested that "the US government might consider a combination of licensing and testing requirements for development and release of AI models above a threshold of capabilities," as seen in a CNBC stream of the hearing linked below.

 Altman acknowledged his love for the open-source AI community during the hearing and even suggested that[AI may one day help tackle climate change](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-ai-help-fight-climate-change/) and cure cancer.

 However, Altman also reminded Congress that a "relatively small number of providers" can make cutting-edge services and tools, with which there comes a "benefit and danger." Altman additionally stated that having fewer forefront AI developers to keep an eye on may benefit the government, so long as consumers still have enough choices.

 During the hearing, Senator Richard Blumenthal referred to AI as a "bomb in a China shop, not a bull." Additionally, politician Amy Klobuchar voiced her concerns on how tools like ChatGPT may contribute to election misinformation.

 So, it's evident that industry professionals and lawmakers are concerned about AI and its future impact. But what effect will further regulation have on the AI industry? Will it be a good or bad thing?

## How Will More Regulation Benefit the AI Industry?

 There are a couple of reasons why AI regulation could be an advantage, both for developers and consumers.

 Firstly, government regulation can prevent the[malicious use of AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-ai-can-help-cybercriminals/) . New technologies are commonly abused by criminals to launch attacks and conduct scams. Given the vast potential of AI, it makes sense to implement regulations around ethical usage so that crimes don't proliferate using this technology.

 For example, AI manufacturers need tight regulation to prevent the production of AI technology that may pose a threat to human life. Alternatively, AI developers and companies may be required to apply for a license before producing and releasing AI-powered hardware or software. A company will need to be audited before being granted permission to produce AI products or have to meet certain testing criteria before release.

 However, some may see AI regulation as bad news, particularly developers who don't want restrictions on what they can and can't produce and release to the public. If AI regulation stops developers from researching and creating groundbreaking technology, such as healthcare equipment, this may prove more harmful to humanity than anything else.

 Some also feel that it's far too soon to be talking about AI regulation, though the presence of AI in so many industries today would seem to contradict that view.

## Is AI Regulation Good News for OpenAI?

 Sam Altman's call for more AI regulation has raised questions about whether such constraints will actually benefit OpenAI.

 It's hard to say whether further regulation will be a net positive for OpenAI. However, in the aforementioned Senate hearing, Altman suggested that AI companies like OpenAI should be independently audited and properly licensed, which suggests that he is happy to participate in this increased regulation.

 It seems that Altman is legitimately concerned about AI getting out of hand, which is why he has addressed Congress. However, during the hearing, Altman did commend ChatGPT, stating that OpenAI's AI chatbot is "more likely to respond helpfully and truthfully and refuse harmful requests than any other model of similar capability."

 It isn't surprising that Altman has something of a bias here, as ChatGPT is the brainchild of the company he runs. But further regulation could lead to larger, pre-established AI companies having an advantage over smaller organizations, especially if licenses, permits, and long testing periods are made a legal requirement (as this could incur more costs and require more personnel).

## AI Regulation Is a Point of Contention

 At the moment, there are many different opinions and ideas surrounding the regulation of AI. While some think this technology needs to be reigned in, others would prefer it stay as it is. In the near future, countries across the world may introduce new AI laws, and we'll have to wait and see whether this turns out to be a blessing or a curse.
