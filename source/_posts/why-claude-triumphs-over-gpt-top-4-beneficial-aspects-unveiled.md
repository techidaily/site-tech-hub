## 1.[Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/prompt-engineering)

![Dr Jules White teaching Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT on the Coursera online learning platform](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-37.jpg)

 Can you use AI to create a Pokemon-inspired game that helps your kids learn math and eat healthy food? Apparently, yes! And there's more you can do with a dose of creativity and the help of ChatGPT, says course developer Dr. Jules White, an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University.

 You've probably heard a lot of bad things about artificial intelligence. Experts expound on[how generative AI will change the job market](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-ai-change-job-market/) , while skeptics enumerate the[signs that AI development is moving too fast and should be paused](https://www.makeuseof.com/signs-ai-development-is-moving-too-fast/) . Dr. White reshapes the negative conversation surrounding AI, emphasizing how you can use it as a tool to unlock human creativity.

 The "motivating examples" in the course show the limitless possibilities of using AI in your work, creative projects, and day-to-day tasks. You'll learn the best prompt patterns, such as persona, cognitive verifier, flipped interaction, question refinement, outline expansion, and more.

 The lectures are content-rich and easy to follow. You'll be inspired to use, instead of fearing, large language models like ChatGPT. You'll understand how AI can be helpful in writing, programming, art, thought experiments, and other creative projects. And at the end of the course, you'll be proud to have written your first prompt and developed your own prompt-based application.

![Screenshot of Ronnie Sheer teaching Introduction to Prompt Engineering for Generative AI on LinkedIn Learning](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-38.jpg)

 Enroll in this online course if you want to learn only the bare-bones concepts in AI prompt engineering. You'll know the difference between tokens and words and how to use AI to generate text and images. At the end of the course, you'll learn some advanced practical concepts, like prompt fine-tuning and interacting with AI models using an API.

 If you haven't followed the latest in AI consumer tech, the course introduces you to today's most popular AI tools. First, you have GPT-related technologies like ChatGPT and its contender Bard from Google. You'll also learn how to create AI-generated images using DALL-E and Midjourney.

 Each topic is concisely explained, providing all you need to begin your AI prompt engineering journey. You'll gain a solid foundation in AI that should lead to more in-depth learning. When you feel like you need more information, you can refer to the other online courses on this list. As Software Developer and Instructor Ronnie Sheer says, AI is a fast-evolving field, so there's always space for continuous learning.

![Dave Birss teaching How to Research and Write Using Generative AI Tools on LinkedIn Learning](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-39.jpg)

 In this LinkedIn Learning course, creative expert Dave Birss shows how Generative AI tools present a huge opportunity to advance your career. As Birss points out, humans usually use technology to automate repetitive activities. Thanks to AI, you can now use tech to automate thinking.

 Automated thinking is often considered a considerable threat, especially for writers and creatives. If AI can think for you, you're replaceable at your job. But you could argue that AI works to your advantage if you use it responsibly and effectively. AI mastery has become one of the[essential tips for writers to succeed in the age of AI content](https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-writers-to-succeed-ai-content/) , just as internet proficiency has become a must-have skill over the years.

 Birss walks you through the basics of writing effective prompts for AI. Applying a mnemonic that you'll learn in the course (C.R.E.A.T.E.), you can give ChatGPT directions to produce high-quality outputs. The course also shows you how to use AI in research tasks like summarizing complex information, viewing information from multiple perspectives, getting expert advice, and more.

 The lessons emphasize that AI does not replace you as a human. Instead, it augments your work so that you can produce better results. When ChatGPT gives you an output, you must still use your skills and judgment to check and refine the answers and deliver the best results.

## 4.[Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/)

![Learn Prompting Website showing Basic Applications lessons](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-40.jpg)

 If you prefer reading rather than watching videos, access the Learn Prompting website. The curriculum takes you through basic to advanced prompting techniques using text-based lessons. The courses are free for everyone and were developed by researchers, translators, and hobbyists.

 Learn Prompting claims that almost every other prompt engineering video uses its material. So don't be surprised if you see the sudden onslaught of AI prompt engineering experts marketing their lessons on your social media feeds.

 You don't need to go through all the materials on the website. If you already have a basic understanding of prompting, you can start with prompting techniques you're not familiar with first. We also recommend exploring the topics you won't usually find in other courses, such as Understanding AI Minds (under Basics) and What's in a Prompt (Intermediate).

 The Learn Prompting site offers bite-sized and practical lessons you can easily bookmark. Use the readings to recall and review AI prompt engineering concepts quickly. This site is for you if you want substantial facts that cover the essentials.

 This course is best for beginners who want to go through the best use cases of ChatGPT quickly. ChatGPT Ultimate Guide familiarizes you with the ChatGPT interface and the OpenAI playground before explaining the numerous practical uses of the AI tool.

 The 59 short videos in this course give you front-row seats to how ChatGPT works. Instructors interact with ChatGPT, typing prompts and commenting on the results. If you haven't tried using ChatGPT, these videos are a great introduction to the app.

 Unlike other videos focusing on different types of prompts, this course gives you multiple scenarios where ChatGPT will be helpful. You'll learn to use ChatGPT to summarize dense text and YouTube videos, rewrite the text, reorganize data, and more. You'll also learn to use ChatGPT in learning, traveling, and home improvement.

 The lessons also explain how AI helps you perform better in specific jobs. For instance, teachers who want to save time should review the videos on Creating Essay, Multiple Choice, Fill in the Blanks, and True or False Questions. Meanwhile, digital marketing professionals will find the videos on Copywriting, SEO and Keywords, and Scripts for Social Media beneficial.

 If you're job hunting, check out these videos for job seekers. You'll learn[how to use ChatGPT to write your resume](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-chatgpt-to-write-resume/) , create a personal bio, search for jobs, and email a potential employer. While the videos only give an overview, they're sure to spark ideas on how the AI tool can be helpful for your job search.

## Learn AI Prompt Engineering Today

 You don't need advanced tech knowledge to enroll in these online courses. You only need a creative mind, access to AI tools, and an openness to explore concepts in artificial intelligence. If you started as a skeptic, you'd come out of these videos more open-minded about the benefits of AI on your career and personal life.

 Anyone can learn AI prompt engineering and use the skill for work and personal tasks. But if you want to go a step further, consider turning your new AI skill into a rewarding career. Some may argue that prompt engineering is short-lived hype, but the decision of whether AI prompt engineering is a suitable career path is yours to make.
