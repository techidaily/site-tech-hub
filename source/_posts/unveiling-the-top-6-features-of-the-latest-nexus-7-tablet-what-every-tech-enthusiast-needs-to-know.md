Nexus7 is a great and successful tablet. Once launched at 2012, this tablet rapidly caught our eyes with ordinary price and balanced configuration. It's said that Nexus7 has taken 10 percent market of Android tablet. But obviously Google dissatisfies this data and the competitiveness of Nexus 7 has declined as time goes by – They need a new and powerful product. So at Google's "_**Breakfast with Sundar Pichai**_" event on July 24th, 2013, we usher the successor of Nexus 7 – the new Nexus 7\. In this article, we list 6 things you may want to know about the new Nexus 7.

1 Thin and light appearance

The new Nexus 7 looks like the predecessor very much at the first sight. But if you look closer, you'll find that it's thinner – about 2mm than the old Nexus 7\. Comparing with the previous bump surface, the new coating rear cover makes it has a soft handling. In addition, the new Nexus 7 is 50 grams lighter than original. Thinner, softer and lighter, these make you feel more comfortable when handling the new Nexus 7.

Let's turn back to the front of this new gadget. Perhaps the biggest change is the narrow bezel. This design provides better sight experience and operation experience. But this makes it look more like a big cellphone, not a tablet.

2 High resolution Display

The new Nexus 7 has a 7 inch IPS display of 1920\*1080 resolution. Google claims it has the highest ppi in tablet – even higher than the Nexus 10 which has 2560\*1600 resolution but has only 300ppi. With this HD display, we could see sharper text and more vivid image, watch 1080P video come to life.

Higher resolution always means higher battery consumption at the same time. But the new Nexus 7 has a good battery life. It adopts a 3950 mAh battery. The official data says it can support 9 hours of video playing and 10 hours of web browsing. This is an amazing performance.

3 The latest Android 4.3

As a member of the Nexus series, the new Nexus 7 runs the latest Android OS certainly. Actually the new Nexus 7 is the first product which runs the latest Android 4.3\. It still calls "Jelly Bean".

One of the most important features of Android 4.3 is _**Restricted Profiles**_. It's very useful for protecting privacy and children development. You can classify the user permission so that the guest and administrator are in different system environment.

4 1.5 GHZ Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset

The new Nexus 7 adopts 1.5GHZ Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset. It's the mainstream configuration of midrange and high end Android cellphones. Comparing with the Nvidia's Tegra 3 chip which original Nexus 7 has, the S4 Pro has more powerful computing performance and better battery saving performance. It's 80% faster than original. The tablet also has a 2G RAM which makes it smoother when running big games or doing multitasking.

5 Front and rear camera

It's a pity that the original Nexus 7 has no rear camera. The only 1.2 MP front camera can only be used for video talking. Now the new Nexus 7 has improved its camera features much – it has a 1.2MP front camera and 5MP rear camera. But we don't know its specific tech parameters yet.

6 Price and release

There are 3 versions of new Nexus 7 at present. They are 16GB WIFI, 32GB WIFI and 64GB LTE. The prices are $229, $269, $349\. The original Nexus 7 is now listed as "no longer available" in Google Play Store. You can purchase the new Nexus 7 on July 30th.
