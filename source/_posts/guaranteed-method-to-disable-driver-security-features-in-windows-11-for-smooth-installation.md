 Are you still using Windows 7 on your computer? It’s time to upgrade to Windows 10\. You’ve probably seen the Windows 7 end of support notification thousand times since April. This article is going to help you along the journey to**upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10** . Read on and go with the details below.

## The reason to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10

 According to Microsoft, they will**end the support for Windows 7 from January 14, 2020** . So what does that mean?

 When Windows 7 reaches the end of support, Microsoft will no longer provide any technical support for any issues, software updates and security updates or fixes for your Windows 7 computer.

## Before the upgrade…

Before starting to perform the upgrade, you’ll need to:

 1) **Check if your Windows 7 computer meets the requirements of upgrade**

Below are the minimum hardware requirements for Windows 10:

| **Component**      | **Requirement**                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Processor          | A 1-gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor                                  |
| Memory             | 1 gigabyte (GB) or RAM on 32-bit versions and 2 GB for 64-bit versions   |
| Hard disk space    | 16 GB for 32-bit versions and 20 GB for 64-bit versions                  |
| Graphics card      | DirectX 9 or later with a Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.0 driver |
| Display resolution | 800×600 pixels                                                           |

 That would be great if your Windows 7 computer exceeds the minimum specifications. In that case, you may get the best from Windows 10.

 2)**Create a full backup of your Windows 7 computer**

 In case something goes wrong during the upgrade process, please make a full backup of your Windows 10 computer. You can simply do that by**creating a system image** .  
 Additionally, the below upgrade process will format the drive which you plan to install the Windows 10 system. So don’t keep any important files on that drive.

 3)**Obtain your product key**

 Although the offer of free upgrade to Windows 10 expired on July 29, 2016 when Windows 10 first released, you can still use your current genuine Windows 7 key to activate Windows 10.  
 But if you don’t have a genuine Windows 7 key, purchase a new Windows 10 key.

## What you might concern after the upgrade…

 Before enjoying Windows 10, we highly recommend**installing the latest drivers** for your computer to have the best experience.

 A device driver enables Windows 10 to communicate successfully with the device connected to your computer. If the driver is old, outdated or missing, you won’t be able to use the device on your Windows 10 computer. On a clean-installed Windows 10 system, there’s a great chance that there would be some drivers you need to update to their latest version.

 You may need to verify your drivers one by one in Device Manager, and update those that don’t have the latest drivers. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go[Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just click the**Scan Now** button, then when it lists the drivers you need to update, click**Update** . The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them –**either manually** through Windows or all automatically with[Driver Easy Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
