## AI-Powered Bing Comes to Mobile

 Microsoft has been going all-in on AI recently. The [ChatGPT-enabled version of Bing](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-bing-gets-chatgpt-ai/) caused a storm online as it threatens to [totally change how we search the internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/is-chatgpt-search-engine-threat/) .

 Now, with around two-thirds of all searches taking place on mobile devices, the company has rolled out new versions of its Bing search app and Edge browser for both Android and iOS with the same technology built in.

 The Bing app has a whole new look, and perhaps the most interesting part is that it now supports voice to help make your prompts and searches even more intuitive.

 You get started by tapping the Bing icon at the bottom of the screen to begin a chat session. Your responses come in the form of text, bullet points, or simple replies, and you can use it for more than just search.[Microsoft suggests](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/22/the-new-bing-preview-experience-arrives-on-bing-and-edge-mobile-apps-introducing-bing-now-in-skype/) you might use it to write emails or poems, for example.

 The chatbot is also built into the Edge browser, where you can access it via the homepage.

### Skype Gets AI Features

 In addition to those apps, Microsoft has added AI-enhanced Bing support to Skype, the venerable voice and chat app. The idea here is not to get the AI to have conversations on your behalf, but to add similar search capabilities to group messages.

> "If your family is chatting about the next family reunion, you can simply ask Bing for suggestions on travel destinations, expected weather forecasts and interesting events around your time of travel, and everyone in the chat will get access to the results."

 To access this feature, you simply need to add Bing to your group chats as you would any other contact. It's available worldwide and can respond in over 100 languages.

To do this, just install one of the apps and follow the on-screen prompts. Microsoft says it has given access to more than a million users across 169 countries so far, with more added every day.

## Test Out AI Chat on Android and iPhone Today

 It was only a matter of time before AI chatbots made the move to mobile. The new version of Bing has certainly shaken up the industryâ€”although it hasn't been without controversy.

 The service frequently hits the headlines thanks to its willingness to churn out incorrect information with complete confidence (and get surprisingly argumentative about it). Microsoft also acknowledges that the performance might be limited in these early days due to bandwidth issues.

 And in its mobile form, it is still very much a search tool, so is not something that's going to be replacing Google Assistant, Siri, Bixby, or any other voice assistant any time soon.
