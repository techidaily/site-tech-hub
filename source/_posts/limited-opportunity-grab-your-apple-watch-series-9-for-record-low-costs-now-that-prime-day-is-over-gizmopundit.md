Apple/ZDNET

Over the past few days, Prime Day brought serious savings to the Apple [Watch Series 9](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CSV9Y331%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cc000e0ee-6f66-4d6b-a89a-2d6bcfba47a9%7Cdtp&dtb=1), which isn't even a year old. Amazon's sale discounted it to its lowest price yet, saving you $119\. Perhaps some of the best news is that this deal is still live, even after the sale has ended.

You can still grab the Apple Watch Series 9 for just $280 -- that beats the prices we saw during Black Friday 2023, Memorial Day 2024, and just a few weeks ago during Fourth of July sales. Remember, [Apple products](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-amazon-prime-day-apple-deals-2024-07-17/) don't often see sales, and this rare offer may be fading as Prime Day sales become inactive.

[Apple Watch Series 9 41mm for $280 (save $119) $280 at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CSV9Y331%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cc000e0ee-6f66-4d6b-a89a-2d6bcfba47a9%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

The Series 9 offers all the newest features and is one step up from the base SE model. The Apple Watch Series 9 can track activity, steps, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen (lung function), wrist temperature, sleep, and environmental sound levels (to protect your hearing). It uses algorithms and machine learning to spot dangerous patterns and alert you to seek medical attention.

**Read the review:** [**Apple Watch Series 9: Don't settle for less expensive models, here's why**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/)

ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner recommended purchasing it over cheaper models after first [reviewing the Series 9 in 2023](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/). 

"Inside the [Apple Watch Series 9](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CSV9Y331%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cc000e0ee-6f66-4d6b-a89a-2d6bcfba47a9%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is the S9 chip, making the popular smartwatch faster, smarter, and better at reading your body signals -- based on my real-world tests next to the last-generation model," Hiner wrote in his review. "That makes this year's Apple Watch Series 9 a generational step up. So, if you're in the market for an Apple Watch right now, I'd specifically recommend getting the Series 9 (or the Apple Watch Ultra 2) because the health tracking is such an improvement from previous models."
