## Newly Released Android 15 Beta Phase 4 Is Here for Testing

Developers and beta testers can now install Android 15 Beta 4\. All things considered, it's a pretty boring Beta release. There aren't any headline-worthy changes here, as Google is simply putting the final touches on the latest iteration of its mobile operating system.

 We're just one month away from the full Android 15 launch. So, while Android 15 Beta 4 is an opportunity to tidy things up, it's also Google's last chance at nudging app developers into action. Apps need to be updated in preparation of Android 15, as there are [several changes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/summary) to the operating system that may break app functionality.

 One change that Google is highlighting in this Beta release (presumably because it's been overlooked by developers) is that Android 15 drops support for PNG emoji files. Apps that utilize custom font renderers need to be updated to support TFF emoji files. Alternatively, developers can bundle a [legacy emoji font](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/blob/main/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf) with their app's APK.

 There are also some new features and behavioral changes in Android 15 that need to be addressed in app SDKs. The big one that Google is trying to hammer down is the [Private Space](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/a-complete-guide-to-oem-unlocking-on-nubia-red-magic-9-proplus-by-drfone-android/) feature, which lets you hide apps and files behind a password-protected vault (or set up a second user profile on your smartphone, kinda).

 And much as I'd love to talk about every new feature in Android 15, it wouldn't be a great use of time. So, I'll just point you to our [Android 15 coverage](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/full-tutorial-to-bypass-your-nokia-105-classic-face-lock-by-drfone-android/) and the official [Android 15 changes list](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/summary).

 If you haven't installed any of the previous Android 15 Beta versions, then there really isn't much of a point in installing today's release. Android 15 is set to make its full debut at the [Pixel 9 launch event](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-fb-video-extraction-creating-mp3s-in-minutes/), which is just a few weeks away.

 The fourth Android 15 Beta is available at the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/get) website. It works on all currently-supported Pixel phones and a small selection of third-party devices from brands like OnePlus. That said, if you don't own a Pixel device, it may be better to test the Beta in the [Android Studio Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
