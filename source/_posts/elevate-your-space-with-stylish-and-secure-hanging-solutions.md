[Kindle app requires update to view content](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/26/2023 5:14:25 AM 

I borrowed 2 books and when I attempt to open them in the Kindle app for PC I get this message: Your kindle app requires an update to view this content. Click here to download and install the free update.   
 I borrowed other books and they open just fine and I can use Epubor Ultimate to convert them.  
 Has Amazon changed file types or what? Any ideas?  
 Thanks

[Can't decrypt Kindle books anymore](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/11/2019 11:46:51 PM 

Hi there, today I opened my Kindle for PC app and I was unable to decrypt a book. Something has changed with the software, so I tried downloading the 1.24 version as I have done before, but with no luck. Epubor cannot decrypt correctly, it basically creates a version of the ebook in HTMLZ, which lacks some essential features, such as the index. I tried installing the older version multiple times, both the 1.24 and the 1.17 but nothing changes.

[New Kindle version](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 12/12/2022 1:45:00 AM 

Hello,  
 I purchased epubor ultimate to get a pdf copy of my kindle purchased ebooks.  
 I kept as much as possible the older version of kindle for mac (44173) but, having to a new macbook with ventura IOS, it is no longer possible to use that version.  
 The new one doesn't not allow to retrieve the single ebooks to be dragged and dropped into epubor but I only get a unique file (book\_asset.db) and I don't know how to proceed.  
 Is there any new procedure available to overcome this change/protection?  
 Thank you for your support.
