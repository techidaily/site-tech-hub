## 1\. Get Advice on How to Prioritize Your Tasks

 ChatGPT can advise you on common task prioritization methods, such as the Eisenhower Matrix, ABCD Method, and the MoSCoW Method. It can also help you choose the most suitable method based on your specific needs and goals.

 For instance, imagine you have a packed schedule for the day and don't know where to start. Enter your tasks into ChatGPT, prompt it to sort things into an Eisenhower Matrix, and get a better sense of your priorities in an instant.

![ChatGPT Eisenhower Matrix example prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-eisenhower-matrix-example-prompt.jpg)

 This approach is named for[U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-second-assembly-the-world-council-churches-evanston-illinois) , who once quoted a former college president's philosophy about time management in a speech.

 "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent," said Eisenhower.

 Following this line of thinking, the Eisenhower Matrix approach helps you sort through tasks based on their importance and urgency. It's a quick way to help you figure out what actually deserves your attention.

 For a different approach, ChatGPT can also streamline your tasks based on the ABCD Method. It's another[popular task management approach](https://www.makeuseof.com/task-management-tips-improve-productivity/) , and the chatbot makes using it a cinch. In the prompt, list your tasks for the day and ask it to apply the ABCD Method.

![ChatGPT ABCD Method part one](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-abcd-method-part-one.jpg)

 If you have a list of pending tasks and don't know where to start, ChatGPT can take a guess at which ones are likely the most important using the ABCD Method. Even if you disagree with the app's initial sorting, it's a quick way to gauge your priorities.

![ChatGPT ABCD Method part two](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-abcd-method-part-two.jpg)

 As this example shows, the chatbot sorts your activities into assignments that require immediate attention (such as working your shift for the day), as well as those that can go on the back burner for a little while (such as returning a call to your doctor's office).

 When crafting your prompt, be as specific as possible, and don't hesitate to rephrase the question or regenerate your first response. In this case, list out every item on your to-do list if you like, and note which tasks are time-sensitive or otherwise critical.

 Although[learning how to write effective ChatGPT prompts](https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/) can take a little time and experimentation, it's well worth the effort. For the most part, giving the chatbot a lot of information to work with, as well as engaging in conversational follow-up questions and clarifications, will provide more helpful responses.

 For the most part, the chatbot can help you determine which of your many tasks deserves your attention the most. For anyone who gets overwhelmed by too many pending responsibilities, this is a simple way to let technology take on a little of the decision-making for you.

## 2\. Streamline Your Workflow With ChatGPT

 Depending on your profession, ChatGPT can also offer specific advice for speeding up your workflow. In this example, we prompted the chatbot to address a common time suck: reading and responding to emails.

![ChatGPT email prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-email-prompt.jpg)

 For this prompt, the chatbot provided some general advice about using templates and unsubscribing from as much as possible. However, you can also drill down to get more specific advice for these issues as well.

 In this case, we prompted the chatbot to free up time wasted on unimportant emails. It provided a long list of advice, including tips for communicating in clear language and staying out of unnecessary conversations.

![ChatGPT unnecessary email advice](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-unnecessary-email-advice.jpg)

 For a more proactive take, the chatbot can also find ways to automate some of your routine tasks. For this example, we prompted ChatGPT to provide some automation ideas for a realtor.

![ChatGPT automation ideas for a realtor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-automation-ideas-for-a-realtor.jpg)

 ChatGPT provided several tips in regard to email marketing, virtual tours, and property listing syndication services that can help realtors excel in their line of work while saving some time. Prompt the chatbot for some advice about time management in your own career for more specific tips.

## 3\. Break Down a Large Project Into Manageable Sections

 ChatGPT can help guide you through breaking down large projects, whether you’re planning to do some home renovation, switch careers, or even launch a podcast. In this case, we prompted the chatbot to help make the process of decluttering a room—something many people find a bit overwhelming—much faster and easier.

 In instances like these, you can even prompt ChatGPT to assume various roles. In this case, we had it present the information like a professional organizer, with a focus on getting through the process as quickly and efficiently as possible.

![ChatGPT decluttering prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-decluttering-prompt.jpg)

 The chatbot provided a series of tips for decluttering more efficiently. Many of them focused on speeding up the process, such as the advice to make rapid decisions about whether to keep or donate a particular item.

 The next time you have a large project to tackle, see whether ChatGPT can help you sort through the steps to make it more manageable and efficient. The chatbot just might offer the right piece of advice to help speed up the whole job.

## 4\. Get Personalized Time-Saving Tips

 Prompt the bot to provide time-saving tips. Tailor the prompts to suit your specific needs (i.e., “provide time-saving tips for people with a long commute” or “provide time-saving tips for software developers”).

 In this case, we requested time-saving tips for people who struggle with procrastination. After all, the tendency to procrastinate is one of the[biggest time management mistakes](https://www.makeuseof.com/time-management-mistakes-to-avoid/) that many people face from time to time. For this prompt, we focused on procrastination around household chores in particular.

 The chatbot offered plenty of practical advice about eliminating unnecessary steps and visualizing the end result for motivation. Given the sheer amount of information that ChatGPT can pull from, it can likely suggest time-saving options for your situation, too. Remember to provide detailed, specific prompts to get the best advice.
