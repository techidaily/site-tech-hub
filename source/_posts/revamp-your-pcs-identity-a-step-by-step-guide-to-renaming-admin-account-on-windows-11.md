##  1\. Change the Administrator Name Using the Settings App

 If you're signed in with a [Microsoft account](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-sim-unlock-vivo-y17s-phones-without-code-2-ways-to-remove-android-sim-lock-by-drfone-android/) instead of a local account, you can change your name using the link in the Accounts window of the Settings app. To do that, press Windows+i to [open the Settings app](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-5-easy-ways-to-multiply-your-youtube-follower-base/).

 To do this using the [Control Panel](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-facetime-call-recording-securing-your-conversations/), open the Start menu and type "Control Panel" in the search field and press Enter. Change the "View by" to "Category" and navigate to User Accounts > User Accounts > Change your account name.
