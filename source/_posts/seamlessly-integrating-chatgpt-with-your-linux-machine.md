![Screenshot of a ChatGPT interaction](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgptprompt_therapist.jpg)

### Tips

* Be honest. Your chats will only be stored on the ChatGPT server and can easily be deleted.
* Use open-ended questions to get the best responses.
* Define your problem clearly.

 While ChatGPT can act as a virtual therapist, it cannot replace actual therapy. Always opt for qualified mental health experts who can provide the right care and support for serious mental health concerns and crises.
