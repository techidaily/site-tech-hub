### Bonus tip: Update your graphics driver

 If turning off color filters doesn’t resolve this issue. Don’t worry! You may also run into this issue if there is something wrong with your graphics driver.

Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact graphics card model and your version of Windows.

**or**
