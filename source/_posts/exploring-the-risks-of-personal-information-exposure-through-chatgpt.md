## Exploring the Proficiency of ChatGPT in Tackling Mathematical Questions

 ChatGPT has enjoyed a surge in popularity, and with that, people from all over the world are finding new ways to apply it to their studies and work. Considering the buzz about the chatbot's errors, however, it’s easy to wonder whether the AI is reliably accurate.

 Can ChatGPT solve math problems? While it’s impossible for the AI-powered tool to solve every problem correctly one hundred percent of the time, it’s important to have an idea of just how accurate the AI is. There's no better way to test ChatGPT than directly subjecting it to a variety of math problems.

## Can ChatGPT Solve Arithmetic and Algebra Problems?

 Before attempting to have ChatGPT solve any complex problems, it’s important to determine whether it understands the fundamentals. One user went viral for finding that ChatGPT would respond with eight when asked what five plus two equals—but as time passes, it’s likely that such basic errors have been fixed.

 You can ask ChatGPT questions by navigating to the OpenAI website. Before you go any further, it’s important to note that you should[use the best version of ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/which-version-of-chatgpt-should-you-use/) —GPT-4—if you want the most accurate results. The free version, GPT-3.5, is suitable for most users, however.

 To start testing ChatGPT, it was subjected to problems involving PEMDAS, fractions, and decimals.

 Pleasantly, ChatGPT was able to solve all the arithmetic problems given to it correctly within seconds. It showed proficiency with topics like PEMDAS and decimals, and supplied explanations without prompting. When asked to explain how it divided four by thirteen to someone unfamiliar with long division, it provided an adequately detailed overview of the steps.

 Next, the test continued with ChatGPT pitted against three problems in Algebra—in this case, testing its familiarity with linear equations, arithmetic sequences, geometric sequences, and quadratic equations. As seen with arithmetic, GPT-4 managed to solve all the problems without error.

## Can ChatGPT Solve Geometry and Trigonometry Problems?

 Seeing as ChatGPT was able to solve arithmetic and algebra problems without error, the challenge proceeded with a few problems in geometry and trigonometry. Despite being faced with a few topics in trig—including the Pythagorean theorem, inscribed angles, and the directrix of a parabola—GPT-4 solved all problems accurately.

 Interestingly, ChatGPT was exceedingly quick to walk back its confident response to the inscribed angle problem as soon as it was asked for an explanation. This is even though it was plainly stated that points A, B, and C all lie on the circumference of the circle, with the clear implication that the inscribed angle theorem would apply to the problem.

 In fact, it contradicted the information given that “all three points are along the circumference of the circle” by suggesting that AB and BC intersect within the circle.

 Essentially, you don’t have to purposefully pressure ChatGPT into giving wrong answers—a brief prompt for explanation was enough to make ChatGPT offer an incorrect answer as appeasement. Unfortunately,[wrong answers aren't the only issue with ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/) , either.

 As with geometry and the topics before it, ChatGPT was able to solve trigonometry problems relating to topics like sinusoidal equations, amplitude, and the sine of complementary angles with ease. When given an incorrect premise in the fourth equation, however, ChatGPT was just as willing to offer a confidently incorrect answer.

![chatgpt solves for x given a cosine equation where 16 times the cosine of 12 times x plus eight equals negative eight](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/trig-1.jpg)

## Can ChatGPT Solve Calculus Problems?

 Finally, ChatGPT’s abilities to solve calculus problems were tested with a simple limit problem and a question about derivatives. Its logical reasoning capabilities and ability to withstand unreasonable criticism were also tested.

 Previous mistakes by ChatGPT didn't inspire confidence regarding whether it would stand by correct answers or eventually submit to forceful but wrong thinking.

 As seen before, ChatGPT's primary susceptibility was to user error. It successfully solved for the limit as x approached 0, and it just as readily solved for the limit as x approached 2 when corrected.

 ChatGPT originally offered the correct solution for the derivative g'(1) given that g(x) was the inverse function of f(x), but it quickly amended its answer to be incorrect when given a vague rejection instead of standing by its solution.

## Is ChatGPT Accurate at Solving Math Problems?

 Overall, ChatGPT is accurate at solving math problems. It is highly capable of answering and explaining questions from a broad assortment of topics in math. The main issue that ChatGPT faces is that it isn’t as capable of correcting false assumptions and misunderstandings—and in some cases, it can affirm mistakes without being prompted to do so.

 That doesn’t make ChatGPT a bad tool for solving math problems. In many cases, ChatGPT serves as a reliable and accurate time-saver—and it’s completely free to use. The mistakes made by ChatGPT don’t condemn it, but they do serve as a reminder that you need to[use the right techniques when working with ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-best-results-from-chatgpt/) and double-check its answers.

## ChatGPT’s Equation Solving Limitations

 ChatGPT doesn’t appear to have any significant limitations in solving math problems, but there are a few rules you should keep in mind as you work with it.

* ChatGPT 3.5 cannot work with images. As it is extremely difficult to describe images accurately, you may find that attempting to explain a problem to ChatGPT that relies on images only leads to errors. You should consider using GPT-4 if you need to use images.
* ChatGPT always answers confidently. If you aren’t familiar enough with math to discern when it gives an incorrect answer but rely on it for learning, you may develop serious misunderstandings about concepts in math over time.
* ChatGPT bends to the will of the user. Regardless of whether you intend to manipulate its answers, it may offer incorrect information to appease you if something in your response triggers it.
* ChatGPT may not pick up on inherent errors in the information that you give it. You should reconsider using ChatGPT for math if you aren’t familiar enough with a concept because it may simply reinforce your misunderstanding.

## Use ChatGPT Carefully When Solving Math Problems

 It’s clear that ChatGPT has an impressive ability to solve math problems ranging from arithmetic to calculus. ChatGPT can be used as a powerful study tool, but it should be used carefully—after all, you’ll only be able to easily identify when it makes errors by developing your math skills enough to double-check its work.

 Rather put the AI-powered chatbot to other uses? There are plenty of creative ways to use ChatGPT as well.
