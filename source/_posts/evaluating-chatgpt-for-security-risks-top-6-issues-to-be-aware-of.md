## Analyzing ChatGPT Plus: To Pay or Not to Pay, That Is the Question

 If you haven't heard of ChatGPT by now, then you must be living under a rock. The large language model (LLM) has millions of users accessing it daily to generate all sorts of things. Letters to your landlord, ideas for content, even a more comprehensive method of Google search, ChatGPT has many uses.

 Jumping on the subscription model bandwagon, OpenAI also offers a ChatGPT Plus option for $20 a month. However, before jumping into purchasing the subscription, you may be wondering whether ChatGPT Plus is worth it?

## What Does ChatGPT Plus Offer?

 ChatGPT Plus offers three benefits to users, with plans to add more. According to[OpenAI's blog post](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus) , these are:

* Access to ChatGPT even during peak times
* Faster response times
* Priority access to new features and improvements

 ChatGPT is so popular that it regularly sees an influx of users. It is quite[common for the service to go offline during peak times](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-at-capacity-right-now-windows/) due to the number of people accessing the website, so the ChatGPT Plus subscription would ensure you don't have to worry about losing access to the LLM.

 While ChatGPT can provide with you an awful lot of content for your queries, it can often be slow in generating its response. This is dictated by the number of users accessing the site at the time, as well as how complex your request is. With ChatGPT Plus, you should see a "faster response time", but there's been no specificity offered on how much faster the subscription version is.

 There are drawbacks to the service, however, namely the fact it wasn't trained on anything past November 2021\. As time goes on, it is logical that OpenAI will add improvements to the service as well as new features. If you pay for the Plus version, then you will receive these before everyone else.

## Who Would Benefit From ChatGPT Plus?

 Even if you're not put off by the price, you may be wondering whether you would truly benefit from the paid version compared to someone else. Essentially, anybody can find a use for ChatGPT Plus if they're interested in the LLM to begin with, but there are definitely some people who have careers that benefit from ChatGPT more.

 Service-based professionals can use it to automate boring, repetitive routines such as creating letters or emails for their customers. Say you need to write a detailed reply to a complaint from one of your customers, for example, you could feed ChatGPT with the original complaint given and ask it to formulate a reply. You could then customize it as you see fit. Even job seekers can find a use, as[ChatGPT is great for writing cover letters](https://www.makeuseof.com/write-cover-letter-using-chatgpt/) .

 Marketing and other creative professionals can use it as a tool for content generation. While it isn't recommended to use the content ChatGPT gives you straight-out-of-the-box, it can be a great tool for both idea generation and for providing you with a first draft of social media posts, ad copy, and more, before you make final touches and spruce it up.

 Programmers can also use ChatGPT to check their code and get ideas on what could be used to improve it. You should bear in mind that one of[ChatGPT's big problems](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/) is that it can't handle basic math, so be aware of that before you take its suggestions as gospel.

## ChatGPT’s Paid Version Could Be Great for You

 ChatGPT has blown away so many people, but its paid version comes with more benefits and seems to be even more useful to users. Most people can get something out of the service. It's up to you to decide whether the paid version is worth it.

 It will be interesting to see whether the free version remains online or whether it eventually becomes a paid-only tool. But for now, there are plenty of things you can do with ChatGPT.
