## What’s OpenAI Got to Do With the New AI-Powered Bing?

 OpenAI is the company responsible for[ChatGPT–the AI-powered chatbot](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai/) that can generate content, answer questions, create marketing strategies, fix code bugs, and more. The AI research lab also launched DALL-E 2 late last year, capable of[generating images based on textual prompts](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-dall-e-2/) .

 Microsoft recently invested nearly 10 billion dollars into OpenAI, and Bing’s new AI prowess is just the start of this long-term strategic partnership.

 According to[Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/) , Bing will be powered by the latest next-gen natural language AI model specifically trained for web searching. The AI model behind Microsoft Bing relies on improvements made on ChatGPT and GPT-3.5, making it much faster and more reliable.

## What's New in Bing?

 Remember when searching was underwhelming and lousy using Bing? Thanks to the new AI web search companion, those days are far behind. Bing will now use AI at its core to deliver enhanced search results that are precisely relevant, allow you to generate content, and, best of all, integrate a brand new chat experience specialized to answering complex queries.

 Microsoft is ensuring that its next-gen search engine is your copilot as you surf the web. You can plan romantic getaways with your partner, write your assignments, and get the best vegan lasagna recipe from Bing’s new interactive AI chat experience. It’s built to handle complex queries that you can refine until you find the answers you’re looking for.

 In response to a typical search query, Bing will now show relevant search results on the left and a comprehensive overview of your search query on the right.

 This means if you search for**“Best flights from London to New York,”** Bing will show you a list of relevant ticketing services in the left pane but a summarized result of the best airline fare according to its AI search algorithm in the right pane.

## What's New in Microsoft Edge?

 Over the past few years, Microsoft has significantly improved Edge with incredible features that have allowed it to compete directly against Google Chrome. With the latest capabilities of Bing + AI, Microsoft has made Edge even more potent with new AI features and an updated look.

 Once you’ve configured the Microsoft Edge on your device, you can directly engage with its AI capabilities, including two core features,**Chat** and**Compose** , that will be integrated into a new version of the Edge sidebar.

 Building on the content-generation capabilities of ChatGPT,**Compose** within Microsoft Edge will let you generate content that customizes to the required tone, format, and length.

 You can use the**Chat** feature to answer complex queries, get detailed financial information on a company, figure out the best way to grill a steak, decide the best framework for your web application, and more.**Chat** relies on your prompts to comprehensively provide you with the best possible answers.
