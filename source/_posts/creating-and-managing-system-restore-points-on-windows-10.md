## Creating & Managing System Restore Points on Windows 10

**System Restore** is a very important and useful function in Windows system. It tracks software installations, driver changes and software updates and allows a user to revert to their prior state if something unexpected happens. The record created by System Restore service is called**System restore points** . Windows automatically creates restore points once a week.   
  
 In Windows 10, this service is still available and fully functional. However, this feature is turned**off by default** , which means that you will not be able to find it available to use the System Restore function if you have not change the default setting to**On** manually before.   
  
 1) Type**restore point** in the search box and choose**Create a restore point** from the list of results.
