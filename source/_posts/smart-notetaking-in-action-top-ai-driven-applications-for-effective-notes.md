 There are many ways[Bing's AI chatbot is improving](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-bing-ai-improving/) .

You can also ask prompts based on photos, which can be uploaded from your device's library or taken on your smartphone camera.

 Beneath every answer, Bing provides several follow-up prompts to help you get the most out of the chatbot. Follow-up prompts also apply to widgets. You can fine-tune images by asking prompts such as "Make the background darker." Overall, Bing is an excellent ChatGPT alternative for creatives. Best of all, it's completely free.
