 A password random generator is a software or program that randomly generates passwords for your account in various software and websites. So it saves your time and patience to manually change your every password from time to time, and you can have the new passwords composed of a string of various letters, numbers, and symbols.

 Someone may be wondering: I can change these passwords using these random characters by myself, so why bother? As a matter of fact, you can manually change all your passwords, but it’s sometimes hard to memorize all the complicated passwords, and sometimes you’ll get confused easily by the different passwords.

 With the random password generator, you can change your passwords automatically and easily. Sometimes you can even customize your password settings to meet your needs. All you need to do is to remember your password to the password manager.

## 2\. Is the random password generator secure

 While choosing a random password manager for yourself, what you most concern is the security problem. It’s never sure whether the company of the password generator will know your new password or not. These companies uses the HTTPS communication protocol that many secure sites do, but it may not be as secure as the bank-level.

 So while choosing your password manager or password generator, you should pay attention to the security issue and better choose one with great reputation.
