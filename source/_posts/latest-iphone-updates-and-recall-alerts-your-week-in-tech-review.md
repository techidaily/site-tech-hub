## Latest iPhone Updates & Recall Alerts: Your Week in Tech Review

This was a big week for tech news, with Apple’s WWDC event, Microsoft’s ongoing Recall problems, and everything in between. Here are the biggest stories you might have missed.

##  The Big News

### [Jabra Is Done Making Elite and Talk Wireless Earbuds](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/avoid-complexity-top-5-free-tools-for-effortless-gif-to-video-transformation/) 

 Jabra won’t make any more wireless earbuds and headsets under its consumer Elite and Talk brands, and instead will go back to focusing on business customers.

##  The Other Stuff

That could make MediaTek another competitor for chips in ARM laptops, as the [first Windows laptops](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/enhancing-stories-through-animations-with-movie-maker/) with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips are about to arrive. AMD and NVIDIA are also rumored to be working on PC ARM chips.

 Meanwhile, Microsoft announced an [all-digital Xbox Series X](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/xbox-series-x-s-new-console-options/), with no disc drive and a lower $450 price tag. There will also be a new limited edition 2TB regular Xbox Series X and a 1TB Series S.
