### Kindle for PC/Mac is not installed (No keys for decrypting Kindle books)

**If you don't have an E-Ink Kindle:**

For removing DRM from your Kindle books, we need some "keys" to decrypt them. And the keys are generated once your purchased Kindle books are synced by Kindle for PC.

Therefore, even you can read the Kindle book on reader apps on your cellphones or tablets. We still recommend you sync them via Kindle for PC for a successful decryption. Follow the guide below.

First of all, please make sure you are using the latest version of our program ([Free Update](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)).

1**Download and authorize Kindle for PC/Mac with your Amazon ID**

Download Kindle for PC/MAC:

2**Launch Kindle for PC/Mac**

Go to Kindle Library, download Kindle books to your computer. Make sure you can open and read them on your computer.

### Handle rented books(Epubor Ultimate)

### Adobe Digital Editions is not installed (No keys for decrypting Adobe Adept books)

To remove DRM from Adobe Adept books, specific "keys" are required for decryption. These keys are generated when books are synced using Adobe Digital Editions.

Therefore, even if you can read the Adobe Adept books on other reader apps like Sony, Kobo, or Google Play, we still recommend ensuring you can read them via Adobe Digital Editions for successful decryption. Here is the guide.

First, make sure you are using the latest version of our program. [Update Epubor software to the latest version for free here](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

1**Install Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) on your computer and authorize your computer with Adobe ID**

[Download Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions.html)

2**Make sure you can read the EPUB/PDF books on ADE**

In general, if you authorized ADE with correct account, you will be able to read Adept DRM protected EPUB books smoothly.

For more tips, please read How to [Convert ACSM to EPUB and Remove DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

3**Run Epubor software**

Drag & drop Adept EPUB&PDF books from ADE tab in the left column to software's main window and remove DRM.

[Back to top](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Adept Key is invalid

If the ADE told you "**Error: E\_LIC\_ALREADY\_FULFILLED\_BY\_ANOTHER\_USER**", that indicates the authorized account is not compatible with the book. If you are sure the Adobe account has no problem, please contact the eBook retailer support to bind the book to your Adobe account.

1Deauthorize the ADE and reauthorize them with the right Adobe ID.

2[_Download ACSM to Epub/epub_](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) via Adobe Digital Editions again.
