### Key Takeaways

* ChatGPT sign-ups are currently closed due to a surge in usage after OpenAI's recent Dev Day event, causing strain on their servers.
* There is no specific timeframe for when sign-ups will reopen, leaving potential new users uncertain about how long they will have to wait.
* OpenAI is actively working to address the issue and ensure a great user experience, but the closure of subscriptions is causing discontent among existing subscribers.

Want to sign up to ChatGPT? Well, you're too late.

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has officially revealed that sign-ups for the leading generative AI tool are closed—at least, they are for now. However, with no specific time frame set for when ChatGPT sign-ups will resume, it's anyone's guess as to how long potential new users will have to wait.

## Why Are ChatGPT Sign-Ups Closed?

 ChatGPT has experienced an enormous surge in usage since OpenAI's ChatGPT Dev Day on November 6, 2023.

 OpenAI used its Dev Day to reveal the latest round of updates to ChatGPT,[including GPT-4 Turbo](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpts-latest-update-explained/) , an upgraded LLM, and its[new custom GPTs option](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-create-a-gpt-to-create-a-customized-version-of-chatgpt/) . Both have proved instant hits with existing users, and with social media feeds chocked full of exciting ChatGPT content, more people than ever want a piece of the AI pie.

 The sudden uptick in users exploring the new tools and people jumping to use ChatGPT placed considerable strain on OpenAI's servers—leading the company to close its subscriptions until the situation is under control.

## When Will ChatGPT Subscriptions Open Again?

 Currently, there is no official information regarding ChatGPT sign-up reopening. OpenAI's hardware has been taking a pounding, and there are more than a few existing subscribers expressing discontent about the diminishing service.

 Slower processing times, periodic downtime, blackouts, and more have seen a considerable uptick since the November 6 event. For those who have rapidly integrated ChatGPT and generative AI into workflows and elsewhere, any downtime is keenly felt.

 However, despite ChatGPT subscriptions being closed, it won't take them long to reopen. Each day ChatGPT's doors remain closed to new users is lost revenue for OpenAI, and that's a situation no business wants to be in—even if the problem is caused by its enormous success.

 If you want to be first in the queue when ChatGPT subscriptions resume, head to the[ChatGPT Sign-Up page](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login?ref=upstract.com) , enter your details and await an email.

## ChatGPT Is a Victim of Its Own Success

 As said above, it's an issue any startup founder wants. But when so many people have integrated or come to rely on the service, ensuring the stability and performance of ChatGPT for existing users is just as important as onboarding more subscribers.

Still, it certainly won't be long until it changes.
