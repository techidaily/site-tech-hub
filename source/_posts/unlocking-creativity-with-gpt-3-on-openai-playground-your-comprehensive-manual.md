## Secure Accounts on Messaging Platforms with Just Your Email - Learn How

 Deciding whether an app is worth handing over a fairly large slice of your online privacy for is worth it can be a tricky dilemma.

 In the past few years, however, there are now numerous options when it comes to signing up for the apps and services you want, without providing your personal information like your phone number.

## The Need to Register With Chat Apps Is Still Strong

 Despite how time-consuming and frustrating it is, the requirement to register and sign up for new chat apps is very prevalent. It’s a rare thing now to hear someone say “I’ll text you”; instead phrases like “I’ll WhatsApp you” are far more common.

 It’s no surprise, therefore, that the desire to use these apps and services is strong. However, many users are refusing to give up their personal details in order to access these apps.

## Receiving SMS Verification Online

 A quick Google search will show you the sheer amount of SMS online services available. Unsurprisingly, however, is that many of them use persuasive language to draw you in, without delivering positive results. Many of these services use temporary numbers, free trials, or even free numbers.

 This can result in your messages taking a long time to be sent and received. Some may not even be received at all.

 However, there are some free services that do produce good results. These are totally free to use so that you can receive your SMS verification for ChatGPT, Telegram, Whatsapp, and others.

### AnonymSMS

[AnonymSMS](https://anonymsms.com/) has been around for some time now, and have really cemented its place in the temporary number market. The service offers hundreds of different numbers that are basically ready to use whenever you need them.

 You can choose from numbers from different corners of the globe, and you’ll even have the choice of using whichever area code you want from the country you have chosen, all for free.

 Research suggests that all AnonymSMS numbers are associated with real SIM cards, thus real numbers. Because of this, their service is totally safe to use.
