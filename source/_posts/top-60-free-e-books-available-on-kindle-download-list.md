Very useful! Thank you for sharing. I was finding different sites to promote books too and these post got huge list, and the comments is also a landmine.

 I would really appreciate if you add our site -&gt;&gt; mybookcushion.com

 It solely promotes FREE and Bargain YA kindle eBooks, so if your readers are into these specific genre, it'll be easier to find them on our site.
