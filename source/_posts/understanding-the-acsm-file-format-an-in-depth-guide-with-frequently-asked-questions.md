### What is .acsm file?

 **An .acsm file** is not a real file, but rather a download link for the eBook you have purchased or rented, which is distributed by Adobe Content Server. The file obtains data from the Adobe Content Server to activate and download the original content of the eBook, such as ePub and PDF formats. 

The .acsm file acts like a connection between the Adobe Content Server and the authorized Adobe Digital Editions ID for the eBook. This means that if you use the same Adobe ID on different computers, you are able to download and open the same DRM-protected .acsm file with Adobe Digital Editions. This is one of the many reasons why so many eBook vendors employ this eBook distribution method, as they believe it can provide seamless fulfillment of books across devices. 

One of the most important reasons why eBook vendors use the Adobe Content Server to distribute their eBook contents to their customers is that it can add DRM protection to the eBooks. This DRM protection helps prevent piracy and ensures that only authorized users can access the eBooks.
