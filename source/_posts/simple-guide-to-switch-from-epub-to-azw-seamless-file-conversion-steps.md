There are many reasons to [convert epub to azw format](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)? You know that epub is one of the most common ebook formats. It's a free and open ebook standard format in ebook world. So you may find that if you purchase some books from bookstores like Google Play, Kobo, Nook, most of those files are in epub format. However, azw is the native Kindle format, widely used in Kindle ebooks. And today there are so many people who use Kindle devices. Unfortunately, Kindle doesn't support epub format. So although Sony, Kobo, Google and other ebook stores also offer the readers a good reading resource, ebooks purchased from these stores can not be read directly with Kindle. If you really want to read those books on Kindle, you need to convert epub to azw. 

### Convert EPUB to AZW with Calibre

### Convert EPUB to AZW via Amazon Email Service

Here, I will introduce a way to convert epub to azw with Amazon's "send to Kindle" service. Use this service to convert epub to azw, you should take following two main steps.

1 Convert epub to pdf using Calibre

Using Calibre, this step is totally the same with the previous one, please operate according to [Convert Epub to AZW Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). You just need to change the output format from "mobi" to "pdf".

2 Attach pdf to email and send to Amazon.

1\. Open a new email.

2\. Put "xxx@kindle.com"(for example, if your amazon registration account e-mail is "xxx@hotmail.com", then your send-to-kindle e-mail is "xxx@kindle.com")?into the address line for paid delivery to your Kindle, or put " xxx@free.kindle.com"?to have the files delivered to the primary e-mail address associated with your Amazon account.

3\. Attach the pdf files you want to convert to azw to the e-mail (at most 25 Max and 50MB each Max).

4\. Send e-mail—To convert the document to Kindle azw format, type "convert" in the e-mail subject line. Otherwise it will just send the PDF to the Kindle as it is, instead of converting it. Next time when you open your kindle, you will receive the converted azw files.

(Note: To have the pdf files successfully converted to azw and sent to your kindle, you should ensure that your amazon account e-mail address and send-to-kindle e-mail address both are listed in your "Personal Document Settings" on Amazom's "Manage Your Content and Devices " web page.)

### Convert DRM Protected EPUB to AZW

Now we come to the most important part of this article. You must have noticed that the ways to convert epub to azw I've mentioned above are restricted by DRM. They cannot convert the formats of DRMed ebooks. For example, when convert formats using Calibre, if the book is DRMed, then this window will pop up.

![drm problem](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/drm-problem.jpg)

So if you want to convert ebook formats using those methods, you need to think of ways to [remove the ePub books' DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) first. And now I am going to recommend an extremely useful program to you—[Epubor Ultimate Converter.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)This program can solve your problems at one time, for it can remove DRM together with changing ebook formats.

3Change the filename's extension from mobi to azw by yourself.

In this case, you don't need to change the filename's extension from mobi to azw.There isn't azw format directly in the output option, so does it in Calibre. Therefore, if you really want azw files, you need to change the ebooks' mobi extension to azw. How to do it? Right click on your converted mobi file, select "rename" option to change the filename's extension from mobi to azw. Done. You can read the azw files on your kindle now.

The ultimate converter--Epubor Ultimate can remove ebooks' DRM first and then convert the formats.

FAIL. You say Calibre can convert to .AZW. It cannot. It can convert to .AZW3, as you can see if you pay attention to your own steps, but not to .AZW.

  
 Please correct or delete this time-wasting page.

Thanks for your advice. In our article, we mentioned that Calibre can not convert the files to AZW format directly and suggest user convert the files to Mobi format at first and then change the extension from Mobi to AZW.
