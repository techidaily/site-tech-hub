## Elevate Your Visual Fidelity with Expert Tips on Managing NVIDIA's 3D Settings

Your NVIDIA Control Panel seems different from others you see from the internet–it**only has 3D settings** . You feel confused and a little worried. Don’t worry, it’s not a big deal. Actually, it’s the nature of your machine.  
 It is because there are two graphics cards on your computer. One is onboard graphics and the other is the NVIDIA graphics card. Display and video option should be set up in the onboard graphics card. So you can only see 3D Settings in the NVIDIA Control Panel.

 But if you used to have other settings and you lose them, you can try these 3 methods to get them back.

1. [Update your graphics card driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Disable the onboard graphics card in Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Restart the NVIDIA Control Panel Process](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Update your graphics card driver

 The reasons for your NVIDIA Control Panel only has 3D settings are various, but it should be related to your graphics card driver. So it’s always a first-to-go option to update your graphics card driver.

There are two ways to update your driver.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-only-3d-settings-in-nvidia-control-panel/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

1. Go to the[NVIDIA download center](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
2. Search for driver according to your graphics card.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nvidia.jpg)
3. Download and install the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update the NVIDIA graphics card drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/g3.jpg)
