### E-book Format Conversion Questions

[What formats does calibre support conversion to/from?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

[Why does the PDF conversion lose some images/tables?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

[How do I convert a collection of HTML files in a specific order?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

[How do I use some of the advanced features of the conversion tools?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

#### **What formats does calibre support conversion to/from?**

Calibre supports the conversion of many input formats to many output formats. It can convert every input format in the following list, to every output format.

_Input Formats:_ CBZ, CBR, CBC, CHM, EPUB, FB2, HTML, LIT, LRF, MOBI, ODT, PDF, PRC\*\*, PDB, PML, RB, RTF, TCR, TXT

_Output Formats:_ EPUB, FB2, OEB, LIT, LRF, MOBI, PDB, PML, RB, PDF, TCR, TXT

\*\* PRC is a generic format, and Calibre supports PRC files with TextRead and MOBIBook headers.

#### **Why does the PDF conversion lose some images/tables?**

The PDF conversion tries to extract the text and images from the PDF file and convert them to and HTML based ebook. Some PDF files have images in a format that cannot be extracted (vector images). All tables are also represented as vector diagrams, thus they cannot be extracted.

#### **How do I convert a collection of HTML files in a specific order?**

In order to convert a collection of HTML files in a specific oder, you have to create a table of contents file. That is, another HTML file that contains links to all the other files in the desired order. Such a file looks like:

   
     Table of Contents
     First File
        Second File
        .
        .
        .
   
Then just add this HTML file to the GUI and use the convert button to create your ebook.

#### **How do I convert my file containing non-English characters, or smart quotes?**

There are two aspects to this problem:

Knowing the encoding of the source file: calibre tries to guess what character encoding your source files use, but often, this is impossible, so you need to tell it what encoding to use. This can be done in the GUI via the _Input character encoding_ field in the _Look & Feel_ section. The command-line tools all have an _\--input-encoding_ option.

When adding HTML files to calibre, you may need to tell calibre what encoding the files are in. To do this go to _Preferences->Advanced->Plugins->File Type plugins_ and customize the HTML2Zip plugin, telling it what encoding your HTML files are in. Now when you add HTML files to calibre they will be correctly processed. HTML files from different sources often have different encodings, so you may have to change this setting repeatedly. A common encoding for many files from the web is cp1252 and I would suggest you try that first. Note that when converting HTML files, leave the input encoding setting mentioned above blank. This is because the HTML2ZIP plugin automatically converts the HTML files to a standard encoding (utf-8).

Embedding fonts: If you are generating an LRF file to read on your SONY Reader, you are limited by the fact that the Reader only supports a few non-English characters in the fonts it comes pre-loaded with. You can work around this problem by embedding a unicode-aware font that supports the character set your file uses into the LRF file. You should embed atleast a serif and a sans-serif font. Be aware that embedding fonts significantly slows down page-turn speed on the reader.

#### **How do I use some of the advanced features of the conversion tools?**

You can get help on any individual feature of the converters by mousing over it in the GUI or running ebook-convert dummy.html.epub -h at a terminal. A good place to start is to look at the following demo files that demonstrate some of the advanced features:

[Why is my device not detected in linux?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

#### **What devices does calibre support?**

At the moment calibre has full support for the SONY PRS line, Barnes & Noble Nook, Cybook Gen 3/Opus, Amazon Kindle line, Entourage Edge, Longshine ShineBook, Ectaco Jetbook, BeBook/BeBook Mini, Irex Illiad/DR1000, Foxit eSlick, PocketBook 360, Italica, eClicto, Iriver Story, Airis dBook, Hanvon N515, Binatone Readme, Teclast K3, SpringDesign Alex, Kobo Reader, various Android phones and the iPhone/iPad. In addition, using the _Save to disk_ function you can use it with any ebook reader that exports itself as a USB disk.

#### **How can I help get my device supported in calibre?**

If your device appears as a USB disk to the operating system, adding support for it to calibre is very easy. We just need some information from you:

#### **What e-book formats does your device support?**

Is there a special directory on the device in which all e-book files should be placed?

We also need information about your device that calibre will collect automatically. First, if your device supports SD cards, insert them. Then connect your device. In calibre go to _Preferences->Advanced->Miscellaneous_ and click the “Debug device detection” button. This will create some debug output. Copy it to a file and repeat the process, this time with your device disconnected.

Send both the above outputs to us with the other information and we will write a device driver for your device.

Once you send us the output for a particular operating system, support for the device in that operating system will appear in the next release of calibre.

#### **How does calibre manage collections on my SONY reader?**

When calibre connects with the reader, it retrieves all collections for the books on the reader. The collections of which books are members are shown on the device view.

When you send a book to the reader, calibre will add the book to collections based on the metadata for that book. By default, collections are created from tags and series. You can control what metadata is used by going to _Preferences->Advanced->Plugins->Device Interface plugins_ and customizing the SONY device interface plugin. If you remove all values, calibre will not add the book to any collection.

Collection management is largely controlled by the ‘Metadata management’ option found at _Preferences->Import/Export->Sending books to devices_. If set to ‘Manual’ (the default), managing collections is left to the user; calibre will not delete already existing collections for a book on your reader when you resend the book to the reader, but calibre will add the book to collections if necessary. To ensure that the collections for a book are based only on current calibre metadata, first delete the books from the reader, then resend the books. You can edit collections directly on the device view by double-clicking or right-clicking in the collections column.

If ‘Metadata management’ is set to ‘Only on send’, then calibre will manage collections more aggressively. Collections will be built using calibre metadata exclusively. Sending a book to the reader will correct the collections for that book so its collections exactly match the book’s metadata, adding and deleting collections as necessary. Editing collections on the device view is not permitted, because collections not in the metadata will be removed automatically.

If ‘Metadata management’ is set to ‘Automatic management’, then calibre will update metadata and collections both when the reader is connected and when books are sent. When calibre detects the reader and generates the list of books on the reader, it will send metadata from the library to the reader for all books on the reader that are in the library (On device is True), adding and removing books from collections as indicated by the metadata and device customization. When a book is sent, calibre corrects the metadata for that book, adding and deleting collections. Manual editing of metadata on the device view is not allowed. Note that this option specifies sending metadata, not books. The book files on the reader are not changed.

In summary, choose ‘manual management’ if you want to manage collections yourself. Collections for a book will never be removed by calibre, but can be removed by you by editing on the device view. Choose ‘Only on send’ if you want calibre to manage collections when you send a book, adding books to and removing books from collections as needed. Choose ‘Automatic management’ if you want calibre to keep collections up to date whenever the reader is connected.

If you use multiple installations of calibre to manage your reader, then option ‘Automatic management’ may not be what you want. Connecting the reader to one library will reset the metadata to what is in that library. Connecting to the other library will reset the metadata to what is in that other library. Metadata in books found in both libraries will be flopped back and forth.

#### **Can I use both calibre and the SONY software to manage my reader?**

Yes, you can use both, provided you do not run them at the same time. That is, you should use the following sequence: Connect reader->Use one of the programs->Disconnect reader. Reconnect reader->Use the other program->disconnect reader.

The underlying reason is that the Reader uses a single file to keep track of ‘meta’ information, such as collections, and this is written to by both calibre and the Sony software when either updates something on the Reader. The file will be saved when the Reader is (safely) disconnected, so using one or the other is safe if there’s a disconnection between them, but if you’re not the type to remember this, then the simple answer is to stick to one or the other for the transfer and just export/import from/to the other via the computers hard disk.

If you do need to reset your metadata due to problems caused by using both at the same time, then just delete the media.xml file on the Reader using your PC’s file explorer and it will be recreated after disconnection.

With recent reader iterations, SONY, in all its wisdom has decided to try to force you to use their software. If you install it, it auto-launches whenever you connect the reader. If you don’t want to uninstall it altogether, there are a couple of tricks you can use. The simplest is to simply re-name the executable file that launches the library program.

#### **Can I use the collections feature of the SONY reader?**

calibre has full support for collections. When you add tags to a book’s metadata, those tags are turned into collections when you upload the book to the SONY reader. Also, the series information is automatically turned into a collection on the reader. Note that the PRS-500 does not support collections for books stored on the SD card. The PRS-505 does.

#### **How do I use calibre with my iPad/iPhone/iTouch?**

1 Over the air

The easiest way to browse your calibre collection on your Apple device (iPad/iPhone/iPod) is by using the _free_ Stanza app, available from the Apple app store. You need at least Stanza version 3.0\. Stanza allows you to access your calibre collection wirelessly, over the air.

First perform the following steps in calibre

Set the Preferred Output Format in calibre to EPUB (The output format can be set under _Preferences->Interface->Behavior_)

Set the output profile to iPad (this will work for iPhone/iPods as well), under _Preferences->Conversion->Common Options->Page Setup_

Convert the books you want to read on your iPhone to EPUB format by selecting them and clicking the Convert button.

Turn on the Content Server in calibre‘s preferences and leave calibre running.

Install the free Stanza reader app on your iPad/iPhone/iTouch using iTunes.

Now you should be able to access your books on your iPhone by opening Stanza. Go to “Get Books” and then click the “Shared” tab. Under Shared you will see an entry “Books in calibre”. If you don’t, make sure your iPad/iPhone is connected using the WiFi network in your house, not 3G. If the calibre catalog is still not detected in Stanza, you can add it manually in Stanza. To do this, click the “Shared” tab, then click the “Edit” button and then click “Add book source” to add a new book source. In the Add Book Source screen enter whatever name you like and in the URL field, enter the following:

http://192.168.1.2:8080/

Replace 192.168.1.2 with the local IP address of the computer running calibre. If you have changed the port the calibre content server is running on, you will have to change 8080 as well to the new port. The local IP address is the IP address you computer is assigned on your home network. A quick Google search will tell you how to find out your local IP address. Now click “Save” and you are done.

If you get timeout errors while browsing the calibre catalog in Stanza, try increasing the connection timeout value in the stanza settings. Go to Info->Settings and increase the value of Download Timeout.

2 With the USB cable

As of calibre version 0.7.0, you can plug your iDevice into the computer using its charging cable, and calibre will detect it and show you a list of books on the device. You can then use the _Send to device button_ to send books directly to iBooks on the device. Note that you must have at least iOS 4 installed on your iPhone/iTouch for this to work.

This method only works on Windows XP and higher and OS X 10.5 and higher. Linux is not supported (iTunes is not available in linux) and OS X 10.4 is not supported.

#### **How do I use calibre with my Android phone?**

First install the WordPlayer e-book reading app from the Android Marketplace onto you phone. Then simply plug your phone into the computer with a USB cable. calibre should automatically detect the phone and then you can transfer books to it by clicking the Send to Device button. calibre does not have support for every single androind device out there, so if you would like to have support for your device added, follow the instructions above for getting your device supported in calibre.

#### **Can I access my calibre books using the web browser in my Kindle or other reading device?**

calibre has a _Content Server_ that exports the books in calibre as a web page. You can turn it on under _Preferences->Network->Sharing over the net_. Then just point the web browser on your device to the computer running the Content Server and you will be able to browse your book collection. For example, if the computer running the server has IP address 63.45.128.5, in the browser, you would type:

http://63.45.128.5:8080

Some devices, like the Kindle (1/2/DX), do not allow you to access port 8080 (the default port on which the content server runs. In that case, change the port in the calibre Preferences to 80\. (On some operating systems, you may not be able to run the server on a port number less than 1024 because of security settings. In this case the simplest solution is to adjust your router to forward requests on port 80 to port 8080).

#### **I get the error message “Failed to start content server: Port 8080 not free on ‘0.0.0.0’”?**

The most likely cause of this is your antivirus program. Try temporarily disabling it and see if it does the trick.

#### **Why is my device not detected in linux?**

calibre needs your linux kernel to have been setup correctly to detect devices. If your devices are not detected, perform the following tests:

grep SYSFS_DEPRECATED /boot/config-`uname -r`

You should see something like CONFIG\_SYSFS\_DEPRECATED\_V2 is not set. Also,

grep CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN /boot/config-`uname -r`

must return CONFIG\_SCSI\_MULTI\_LUN=y. If you don’t see either, you have to recompile your kernel with the correct settings.

### Library Management Questions

[What formats does calibre read metadata from?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

[Where are the book files stored?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

[Why doesn’t calibre let me store books in my own directory structure?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

#### **What formats does calibre read metadata from?**

calibre reads metadata from the following formats: CHM, LRF, PDF, LIT, RTF, OPF, MOBI, PRC, EPUB, FB2, IMP, RB, HTML. In addition it can write metadata to: LRF, RTF, OPF, EPUB, PDF, MOBI

#### **Where are the book files stored?**

When you first run calibre, it will ask you for a folder in which to store your books. Whenever you add a book to calibre, it will copy the book into that folder. Books in the folder are nicely arranged into sub-folders by Author and Title. Metadata about the books is stored in the file metadata.db (which is a sqlite database).

#### **Why doesn’t calibre let me store books in my own directory structure?**

The whole point of calibre‘s library management features is that they provide a search and sort based interface for locating books that is _much_ more efficient than any possible directory scheme you could come up with for your collection. Indeed, once you become comfortable using calibre‘s interface to find, sort and browse your collection, you won't ever feel the need to hunt through the files on your disk to find a book again. By managing books in its own directory struture of Author -> Title -> Book files, calibre is able to achieve a high level of reliability and standardization. To illustrate why a search/tagging based interface is superior to folders, consider the following. Suppose your book collection is nicely sorted into folders with the following scheme:

Genre -> Author -> Series -> ReadStatus

Now this makes it very easy to find for example all science fiction books by Isaac Asimov in the Foundation series. But suppose you want to find all unread science fiction books. There’s no easy way to do this with this folder scheme, you would instead need a folder scheme that looks like:

ReadStatus -> Genre -> Author -> Series

In calibre, you would instead use tags to mark genre and read status and then just use a simple search query like tag:scifi and not tag:read. calibre even has a nice graphical interface, so you don’t need to learn its search language instead you can just click on tags to include or exclude them from the search.

If the icons doesn't show up, please[refer to this answer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ebook-converter/).

Then choose the book you want to transfer, click "Send to device" button. In most cases, you can simply choose "Send to main memory", but if you need to save the book with a specific format, you should choose "Send specific format to". If you have plugged a SD card or something similar, just choose the correct place where your books stored.

![calibre send to disk](https://www.epubor.com/images/remote/D4/1D/D41D8C_calibre-send-to-disk.jpg)

#### **How to transfer books to eReader or tablet devices through WiFi with Content Server feature?**

If you don't have a USB cable, and you are in a WiFi environment, you can directly transfer the books to your reading device with Calibre's Content Server feature through WiFi, no need to connect your device to computer with a cable.

Before operating this method, please make sure your device and your computer are connected into the same network. Then click "Content / share", choose "Start Content Server" as the left part of the image below.

Do you want to convert .docx to .epub books, or convert PDF to ePUB?  
 It's easy to convert PDF to ePUB with Calibre, but the quality is not perfect.  
 For converting .docs to .epub, you need [convert .docx to .pdf](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) at first.

 Here you can [convert PDF to ePUB](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) with better quality.

Converting them to same format like AZW3/MOBI may solve this problem.

Absolutely useless piece of crap. I just wanted to do a simple thing: to convert my \*fb2 files into \*mobi files and preserve my file names and folder structure because i ALREADY HAVE complete collection of what i need. NOWAY. THis shit knows better than me. Never going install it again.
