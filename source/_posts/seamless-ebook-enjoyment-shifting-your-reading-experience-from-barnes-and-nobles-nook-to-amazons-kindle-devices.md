How do we read Kindle books on Nook? That seems to be an odd question. If you have ever heard of Amazon and Barnes&Noble, you will know they are strong competitors in the field of eBooks and both of them not only possess eBook stores but also provide eReaders. So here's the problem, why do people purchase eReaders from one store and buy books from the other? Obviously, some people prefer to purchase ebooks from Amazon while reading them with Nook eReader instead. And here are 2 methods to read Kindle books on Nook eReaders.

**Key important: convert the Amazon DRMed ebooks to DRM-free epubs.** 

### Method 1: Convert Kindle books to Nook.

In order to read Kindle books on Nook eReader, you just need to remove DRM from your Kindle books and convert them to epub files. So you can transfer the epub file to your Nook eReader for reading. And you can follow below guide to convert Kindle books to epub.

1Download Kindle books via Kindle for PC/Mac

[Download kindle for PC/MAC](https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16571048011&ref=kcp%5Ffd%5Fhz), and install it on your computer. Then sign in with your Amazon account, and click the kindle book cover to download kindle books.

Next add Kindle books to the right main window to remove DRM. Lastly, choose ePub as the output format, then click Convert to ePub, and you will get ePub files.

I read through the instructions and it mentions being able to read the books on Nook Color once they are reformatted. However, I have the original Nook... will it work as well? My son gave me an Amazon gift card for Christmas thinking I had a kindle. He meant well, but I want to use it for books without buying a kindle.

Will I lose any of my other downloads, ie; books from friends, all my books currently on file from ePub, or games previously downloaded?

It says things like "If your Kindle books are Mobi formatted..." .

 How do you know what format your Kindle books are in. I have my Kindle books on Toshiba computers.  
 Do I understand correctly that Nook uses the EPub format?

 thank you.

Hi Kyle,

 The file extension of the book is the format of your Kindle book. Usually DRM free Kindle books are mobi format.  
 Nook supports both EPUB and PDF format. But for a better reading experience, you'd better choose epub format.

If you have a nook table you can go onto the web. Go the the google app store and search the kindle app. Then just down load and buy and read right on your nook with the kindle app. I just did it and works fine. But you have to go on the web and find it. If you just search the shop of your nook you wont find the kindle app.

Can you do that, go into the web, on all Nook tablets? I'm looking at getting a glowlight 4 or 4e. Also do you download the Google Play store to the Nook and then download Kindle reading app? Did you go on the web and just Google "Kindle reading app"? Sorry f9r so many questions. Your way seems much easier.

Thank you for your comments. For reading kindle books on nook, it depends on your nook model. If your nook is tablet, you can just install the kindle app on nook, and then read kindle books with the kindle app. If you are using the nook ereader, you need to strip nook drm and then transfer the kindle books with no-drm to your nook ereader for reading.

I looks like all these procedures allow you to read Kindle book on the Nook app on a computer. Once you convert the file to a Nook compatible format on you computer, how do you upload it onto a Nook?

Hi, Steve

 You can just drag your converted books to the Nook reading app.If you want to read them on your Nook device, you can transfer them to your Nook eReader via USB.

 Thanks.

So this is a trick to get people to download software they don't need. You can download it for free and it does decrypt the files but it will only give you 20% of the book unless you register the software and to do that you have to pay $27.00 so it's not really free is it.

You are using the trial version. It will decrypt and convert 20% content of each book.  
 Here is the solution:  
 Solution 1: Buy the full version.

 Solution 2: Ask for customer support team to ask for temporary license.

 Solution 3: Contact editor team to help translation the software or one article in exchange of a free license .

Do you mean I need to break out my mothballed PC, go thru all this rigmarole and transfer all 1700 (you read that right) books to my Nook?! Won’t the app do that? I’m not even sure my PC is safe to use anymore.I quit using it after it refused to download iTunes four years ago.
