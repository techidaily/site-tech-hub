##  Three Ways to Uninstall a Printer

 There are three different ways to remove a printer from a Windows PC. 

1. If you’re only looking to remove the printer’s connection from your PC and without deleting the printer’s drivers, use the Settings app method. This method ensures the selected printer doesn’t appear in any print dialog boxes.
2. If you want to completely remove a printer (and the associated drivers), use the Device Manager method. This is helpful if you’re [troubleshooting issues with the printer](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-realme-gt-5-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).
3. The third method is a command line method that removes the printer’s connection from your PC, just like the Settings app does.

##  Uninstall the Printer Using the Settings App 

 If you’re on a Windows 11 PC, head into Settings > Bluetooth & Devices > Printers & Scanners. On Windows 10, navigate to Settings > Devices > Printers & Scanners.
