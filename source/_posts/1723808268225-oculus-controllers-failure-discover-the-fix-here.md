### Fix 5 – Update your device drivers

 Drivers matter a lot to the performance of your devices. To keep your VR rig up and running and gain the most smooth experience with Oculus Rift, Rift S or Quest, you should install the latest device drivers on your computer all the time.

There are mainly two ways to update the drivers for your Oculus devices:

**Option 1 – Manually** : You can search for the most recent Oculus driver from its **[support page](https://support.oculus.com/)**  . Then, download the driver that is compatible with your Windows version, and install it step by step.

**Option 2 – Automatically** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your headset, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update** next to the flagged Oculus driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)
