## 1\. The Arrival of GPT-4 Turbo

 Without a doubt, the most significant addition to ChatGPT is the GPT-4 Turbo model. While GPT-4 Turbo is not an entirely new AI model, it features several game-changing improvements, including a larger context window, a more recent cutoff date, improved instruction following abilities, and improved multimodal abilities. How will this impact your ChatGPT experience?

 According to OpenAI, GPT-4 Turbo will ship with a significantly larger 128,000 token context window. This means ChatGPT users will be able to use significantly longer and more detailed prompts when dealing with the AI chatbot. To put it in perspective, you’ll be technically able to provide prompts as large as 300 pages of text. This is the largest context window of any commercially available AI chatbot, outperforming[Anthropic's Claude 2](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-claude-2-what-can-you-do-with-it/) , the previous title-holder, which has a 100,000 token context window.

 GPT-4 Turbo also comes equipped with an up-to-date knowledge base that extends through April 2023, making it one of the most current AI models in the AI chatbot space. Technical improvements to how the model works will also facilitate its ability to follow the fine details of your instructions without straying.

 It's worth noting that the data cut-off applies to GPT-4 Turbo's general knowledge. If you ask a specific question, GPT-Turbo now turns to its integrated browsing mode to answer any question, so you're technically unlimited in the scope of queries. For example, in the image below, ChatGPT confirms its new data cut-off point, then correctly answers who won the 2023 F1 World Drivers Championship.

 Also, ChatGPT Plus users can rejoice—the cumbersome dropdown menu for switching between models will soon be retired. ChatGPT’s upgraded multimodal skills owing to GPT-4 Turbo’s upgrades will allow it to automatically select the optimal model for a given task, goodbye to manual toggling. This improvement may seem minor, but power users will appreciate not having to constantly switch models mid-conversation.

## 2\. Ability to Create Custom GPTs

 GPT-4 Turbo’s arrival is big news, but what you’ll perhaps find more exciting is the ability GPTs feature. In its simplest form, custom GPTs allow you to create mini versions of ChatGPT customized for specific purposes. ​I knocked up an example of an extremely basic custom GPT in seconds, asking the model to help me in Football Manager 2024.

 For instance, say you want to identify and tag smartphones from images using ChatGPT Vision. ChatGPT doesn't know all the latest phones, so you have to teach it every time. This can be annoyingly repetitive. With a custom GPT, you could build a mini GPT pre-loaded with smartphone data so you can skip straight to prompting it to identify new devices anytime.

 You could make other custom GPTs as well, like one for movie recommendations primed with a database of films. Then prompt your custom movie bot anytime you want a recommendation. The best part is that you’ll eventually be able to share these specialized GPTs publicly and potentially profit when others find them useful. Custom GPTs allow you to easily customize ChatGPT for specialized purposes beyond its general knowledge without the need to write any code.

## 3\. Use Pre-Listed GPTs

 You can build a custom GPT, or you can choose from a long list of hundreds of pre-built options to supercharge your prompting experience. Since they are optimized for particular functions, you can get even better responses than regular ChatGPT for niche uses. The[pre-built GPTs have already been primed](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-chatgpt-my-gpt-bots/) with specialized knowledge to supercharge performance for targeted prompting.

![list of new integrated chatgpt bots november 2023](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/list-of-new-integrated-chatgpt-bots-november-2023.jpg)

 With so many to select from, you can find a tailored GPT for nearly any purpose you can imagine. Options include a Creative Writing Coach to provide feedback on your work, a Math Mentor to explain complex concepts, and a Trip Planner to craft your perfect vacation. You can even get a Laundry Buddy for stain help or a Game Time assistant to explain the rules for family game night. Each prebuilt option has niche expertise to deliver superior performance for prompts related to its focus area. With this expansive range of GPTs, you can easily find a customized AI with the ideal skills and knowledge to supercharge prompting in your unique domain of interest. GPTs allow you to tap into the power of customized AI without the effort of creating your own.
