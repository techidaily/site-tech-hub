## BMW Car Owners Rejoice: How iOS 17 Fixes Previous Issues with Wireless Chargers for iPhone 15 - Insights

Apple

Apple has released yet another software update for the iPhone and iPad in the form of iOS 17.1.1/iPadOS 17.1.1.

While the release notes for the iPad update are blank (which may suggest these are purely minor bug fixes for the tablets), the iOS update lists two fixes:

**Also: [iPhone 15 review: I spent a month with Apple's base model and found it more 'Pro' than ever](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/)**

* In rare circumstances, Apple Pay and other NFC features may become unavailable on iPhone 15 models after [wireless charging in certain cars](https://www.zdnet.com/article/bmws-wireless-charging-can-destroy-your-iphone-15/).
* Weather Lock Screen widget may not correctly display snow.

iOS 17.1.1 update

That wireless charging bug was particularly worrying: iPhone 15 owners reported that using their car's built-in wireless charging feature to charge their new iPhone 15 handsets would cause the NFC chip to stop working, killing features such as Apple Pay. Affected users would see a "Could Not Set Up Apple Pay" error message in the Wallet app, and rebooting or resetting the iPhone didn't fix the problem. 

The only fix for affected iPhones was a replacement.
