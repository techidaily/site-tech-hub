[Free Trial Activation](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/12/2019 3:42:41 PM 

The website says that there is a 30 day free trial, but the program asks for a registration code. How can I try before buying?

[Unsupported DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/16/2016 11:27:23 PM 

I download DRM removal for free trial and want to decrypt some EPUB files, when I drag them to the software, most of them are decrypted, but only the rest one failed and I get the error message "your book is protected by a kind of DRM we do not support". 

 It's strange. I can read all of them via Adobe Digital Editions. Anyone knows how to fix this problem?

[eBook conversion failed](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/18/2016 3:06:12 AM 

I used the free trial today to convert my epub books to mobi, all was working well. It worked for about another 80 books but now just keeps coming up with a 'failed' message beside the book whenever I try to convert the format.

[Free trial?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/14/2019 3:27:54 AM 

I was looking to test the epubor product by converting an .aax file to mp3\. It only converted 10 minutes, which is understandable under a free trial basis. However, I need to know how it will parse a 10 hour audio book .aax. Will it break it up into 10 minute segments? Will it break it up into chapters as audible does? What??

[Free trial needs paid license?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/8/2021 3:29:22 AM 

Hello. I just downloaded a free trial for Mac and tested on a Kindle book. It opens with the message: "Please register the software, then get all contents and the valid ebook format."

 Can I register without first paying?  
 If I like the software I would buy the Lifetime License but want to be sure first.  
 Thank you.

[Limits on trial version of Epubor Ultimate?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 2/5/2021 10:55:46 AM 

You offer a 30-day free trial of Epubor Ultimate. What limits are there on the use of the trial version? (I want to test conversion of up to 5 AZW3 files that are locked by DRM before comitting to purchase).

[Free trial limit the number of page to convert to 40?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/25/2020 3:47:15 AM 

Hi,

 I just wanted to try your converter for an ebook I uploaded from Amazon via Kindle for PC (Version 1.24 as you were suggesting).  
 It worked but only for 40 pages, despite the fact the book as many more pages (that I can access on Kindle in the Cloud)!  
 My question: Is it a normal limitation or is there a problem Or I did somethgn wrong? 

 Best regards  
 Axel.  

[Am I free??](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/28/2019 1:09:25 PM 

I want to make sure I’m not paying for epubor ultimate. Back in December I signed up for the free trial version (30 days). I do not remember giving my credit card information (though my memory may be playing tricks on me). I expected the program to stop working after 30 days, but it didn’t. Since this happened 8 months ago, I don’t remember the steps I took to install the program. How can I know if Epubor is charging me for using this program? Everything works just fine, which is highly suspicious. Every time I open it, a window asking for my registration code pops up, but I just close it and use the program. Does this window pops up for those of you who have payed for Epubor? Also, the program (in the configurations part) says that I’m licensed to a free trial. I guess it should have my email there if I had paid for this.  
 Maybe I’m being paranoid. Help??

Good afternoon--

 Yesterday, I downloaded the Epubor KCR Converter trial version. I installed it today, and I'm getting a "Register your program" window. How do I close this window to try the program?

 Thanks!

[How to convert decrypted files to MOBI](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 10/20/2020 3:17:46 AM 

I've downloaded the free trial software and have decrypted an ePub file. I know it only decrpts 20% of the book, and I can preview it on a webpage.

 How do I convert it to MOBI so I can load it on my Kindle and view how the software works?

 I'm not adverse to purchasing the full version, but I'd like to see how it works first. 

 Would greatly appreciate some feedback.

Hi,  
 I would really buy your product, but with the free trial, i have noticed that some words in the text are not well transformed. Sometimes there are some weird characters.  
 For this reason I would like to ask you a temporarly trial for the full conversion.   
 thank you very much   
 Sincerely  
 Marta

I wanted to try out Epubor before buying it.I started with a 300page book. I removed the DRM and then converted it to a pdf. The Pdf only has 6 pages though. Does the free trial only allow you to convert 6 pages?

[Free trial - unable to test the product](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/7/2021 9:04:30 PM 

Hello, I'm really interested in epubor so I downloaded the software to test the product.  
 I followed each step of the guide, was able to remove the DRM and to open the decrypted ebook.  
 The txt file says that I can read 20 percent which is okay for a trial version. But unfortunately this is not true, because I can't even read 1 percent of the book, the txt file is pretty much empty and has a 1Ko size...  
 I tried with an other book, same result.  
 So in fact I can't try the product at all, and I really want to be able to try it because it seems like an amazing product !  
 Can you help me in this matter ?

[Free trial makes "only text" ePUB correct?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/27/2022 3:31:34 PM 

Hi,

 I have installed the free trail and converted an Adobe DE ePub. It turns out just flat text without pictures / book cover etcetra. Is this correct? Is this due to the free trial, or is this "just what it is"?

 Thx!
