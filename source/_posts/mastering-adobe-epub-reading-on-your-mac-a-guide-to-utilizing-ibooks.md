iBooks for Mac is really pretty good to read eBooks purchased from the Apple store, for you can download the latest best-selling ebooks or your favourite classics at anytime and anywhere. But if you were also a crazy ebooks lover as me, you may find that you couldn't read epub books bought from other ebook stores, such as rakuten kobo, Sony reader, and so on.

Here I'm very pleased to tell you that I've found the reason and the solution. And this is also the reason why I write this article. The more people know the news, the happier I would feel.

### Why we couldn't read Adobe EPUB Books on Mac

As a matter of fact, most of the EPUB eBooks purchased from Sony, Kobo, or other ebooks stores are protected by **Adobe DRM**. In general, we can read these epub ebooks on dedicated eReaders, but we couldn't read them on other devices such as iBooks for Mac, because of the DRM limitation.

In other words, if we could **remove the Adobe EPUB DRM**, it would be available to read Adobe EPUB books on Mac.

Here is the guide, 2 parts are covered here concerning how to use iBooks for Mac to read Adobe EPUB books, among which part 1 is especially important I think. 

### Part 1: Remove DRM from Adobe ePub books on Mac

#### Step 1: Make sure you can read ePub books on Adobe Digital Editions.

Download and install [Adobe Digital Editions for Mac](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions.html), and authorize your ADE with your Adobe ID. Then what's the left work you have to do is just to make sure that these epub files can be read on Adobe Digital Editions.

If you want to know more about the details, please refer to [how to read eBook on Adobe Digital Editions](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

##### Note:

If you failed to read your ePub eBooks on ADE, it would be difficult to remove the Adobe DRM. Please delete all your epub books under **ADE folder**(Users/... (Your computer name)/Digital Editions/...) and redownload them with the newly authorized ADE.

#### Step 2: Remove Adobe EPUB DRM with Epubor Ultimate.

Download and install [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) for Adobe protected epub files.

[Windows Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [Mac Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

Run the software, usually if your books are saved in the default ADE path, it will automatically detect and upload them. You can see your books under "Adobe" icon. If not, you can also click "User Center" to set your eBook path or simply click "Add" button to load eBooks, or just drop & drag the Adobe ePub books to the main interface.

 Once you have added files to the left main window, all the books will be decypted within seconds. Simply click "Decrypted" to open output folder. As the following image you see.

**Success**, now the protected Adobe ePub books turn to normal (DRM-free) ePub files, which you can read it directly with iBooks for Mac.

### Part 2: Read the DRMed eBooks with iBooks for Mac

Run the **iBooks** **app** on your Mac.

And then you have to find the DRMed ePub books, right-click and select the "**open with iBooks**".
