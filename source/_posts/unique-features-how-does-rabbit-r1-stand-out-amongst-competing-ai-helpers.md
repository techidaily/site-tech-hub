## Unique Features: How Does Rabbit R1 Stand Out Amongst Competing AI Helpers?

### Key Takeaways

* The Rabbit R1 is a handheld device that offers a new way to interact with AI beyond smartphones and computers.
* It uses a Large Action Model (LAM) to understand complex requests and perform tasks across different web apps and websites.
* The device can learn from you through its "teach mode," and learn any phrase or command to perform tasks.

 The Rabbit R1 unveiled at CES 2024 seems to have gotten the tech world talking. What exactly is it, and how is it different from other AI products?

##  Rabbit R1 Hardware Specs

 The R1 is the brainchild of Jesse Lyu, who dreamed up "the simplest computer, something that is so intuitive that you don't need to learn how to use it." It is a handheld gadget that offers a new way of interacting with AI beyond smartphones and computers.

 Hardware-wise, it sports a 2.88-inch TFT touchscreen display, a push-to-talk button, a far-field mic, and a 360° rotational camera. Under the hood, the device is powered by a MediaTek MT6765 Octa-core (Helio P35) processor with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It's got [all the usual sensors you'd find on a modern device](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-game-masters-top-ten-female-gaming-influencers/)—accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS—plus Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi at 2.4GHz + 5GHz, and 4G LTE for connectivity.

 The R1 comes in bright orange and features 2W speaker output, a dual microphone array, an old-school analog scroll wheel, and a SIM card slot (unlocked). Furthermore, it supports a photo resolution of 8MP, 3264x2448, and a video resolution of 24fps, 1080p. It is powered by a 1000mAH rechargeable lithium battery, which you can charge with a USB-C cable. However, no accessories are included with the purchase.

##  Rabbit R1 Uses a Large Action Model (LAM) to Perform Tasks for You

 The R1 runs a dedicated operating system called Rabbit OS powered by a Large Action Model (LAM). The LAM helps the device understand complex requests and take action across different web apps and websites. If you asked Google Assistant or Siri to book flights or order you a coffee, the best they could do is say, "Yeah, sure, here are some websites where you can book flights or order a coffee…" without actually carrying out the task.

 However, with the R1, for example, you can say something like, "Rabbit, please order more dishwasher detergent from my usual brand on Amazon." It will access your Amazon account and place the order, assuming you frequently order from a particular brand. You don't need to open Amazon's website or click through multiple things. This also applies to music streaming, ride-sharing, banking, social media, and more. You can say, "Play Today's Hits playlist on Spotify," or "Call me an Uber for six people to the airport," and Rabbit R1 will interface with those services to fulfill your request.

 Unlike smartphones or computers, the Rabbit R1 doesn't have specific apps installed on it. Instead, it interacts with the web apps and services you authenticate through its web portal called the Rabbit Hole.

##  Rabbit R1 Can Learn from You

 The cool thing about Rabbit R1 is that it's not just an AI assistant that follows commands—the "bunny" can actually learn new things and preferences from you when you trigger its "teach mode." When teach mode is on, Rabbit R1 will record your screen as you show it how to do stuff in web apps and websites.

 For example, you could walk Rabbit through ordering a custom pizza on your favorite delivery app. You could show it to do stuff like, "First open the app or website...tap on create a new order...next choose the crust..." You get the idea. Rabbit R1 will observe and memorize your actions, so it can do the same later when you ask for "my special pizza order."

 Additionally, you can teach Rabbit R1 any phrase or command using your own voice and language. Maybe you want it to pull up the batting stats of your favorite baseball team when you say, "How's my swing looking?" You can teach it that command, and Rabbit will add it to its repertoire.

##  The Rabbit R1 Won't Replace Your Smartphone

 Before you get too excited, let's get one thing straight: the Rabbit R1 will not replace your smartphone. At least, not anytime soon.

 The R1 has a limited hardware capacity that can't compete with your smartphone's processing power, storage, battery life, and camera quality. For example, the R1 might not be your cup of tea if you're a gamer. Its small screen, limited graphics, and lack of dedicated gaming controls make it less than ideal for gaming. Sure, you might be able to play simple games like trivia, word, or puzzle games that work with its voice and touch interface. But for those high-performance, graphics-heavy, control-intensive mobile games? Probably not the best choice. And if you're into watching videos, the Rabbit R1 might leave you feeling a bit frustrated. Its screen resolution isn't as high as modern smartphones, its speaker isn't the strongest, and it doesn't have a headphone jack.

 The R1's main selling point is that it can help you reduce your screen time and improve your focus and productivity. The creators claim that using a voice-only device can avoid the distractions and negative effects of staring at a screen all day. They also claim that by using a voice-only device, you can communicate more naturally and efficiently with your AI assistant and get things done faster and easier. However, these claims have yet to be tested in the real world.

 The Rabbit R1 might actually be more distracting and frustrating than your smartphone because it mostly forces you to use voice as your input method, which may not always be the best or most convenient option. Voice is a relatively slow and noisy input method that requires you to speak clearly and loudly and sometimes repeat yourself. Output-wise, it requires you to listen carefully and attentively and to ask for clarification or confirmation. Using voice can also be a socially awkward and inappropriate input and output method. Especially when you have to talk to a device in public or in front of others and expose your personal information and preferences to others.

 In contrast, your smartphone gives you the choice and flexibility to use voice or other input and output methods, depending on your context and preference. You can use your voice when it's convenient and comfortable, such as when driving or cooking or when you want to have a casual conversation with your AI assistant. In addition, you can use other input and output methods, such as touch, text, or gestures, when they're more efficient and effective, such as when you're reading or writing or when you want to have a precise or private interaction with your AI assistant. Besides, you can manage your screen time and avoid distractions, such as turning on do not disturb mode, setting app limits, or using dark mode on your smartphone.

 Maybe R1 might get sophisticated enough down the road to replace your traditional device. But for now, your iPhone or Android is probably safe.

##  Rabbit R1 Release Date and Price

[According to the official website](https://www.rabbit.tech/), the Rabbit R1 has a $199 price tag, excluding extra fees like taxes, shipping, and import duties for orders outside the US and Canada. As for how many you can pre-order, you can only purchase up to 5 units per order as of the time of writing.

 If you are pre-ordering from the US and Canada, here's a rough timeline of when you should expect to receive your new gadget:

* The first batch should ship out around March or April 2024.
* The second batch should follow in April–May 2024.
* Batch number three is expected to be in May–June 2024.
* Then, batches four, five, and six are slated to ship in June–July 2024.

 For international pre-orders beyond the US and Canada, the expected shipping date is, unfortunately, less clear at this point. The company thinks units will start heading to other countries later in 2024, but it doesn't have specifics to share yet.

 These shipping estimates are subject to change based on manufacturing capacity and component availability.

 The Rabbit R1 is teeming with potential. It could potentially herald the end of the era of smartphones and computers. But does the Rabbit R1 truly live up to all the excitement surrounding it? That's a judgment only you and the test of time can make.
