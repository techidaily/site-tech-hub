 The cryptocurrency industry is fast evolving. A few years back, we thought Bitcoin's only use was as a store of value and currency. Today courtesy of[Bitcoin ordinals](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals-how-differ-from-nfts/) , Bitcoin can now support NFTs. Often, you'll come across many such crypto terms that need some explaining, and this prompt helps you to understand them better.

## ChatGPT Crypto Prompts Are Like Cheat Codes

 ChatGPT crypto prompts can be likened to cheat codes. They significantly reduce the time and effort you need to become informed. In this age, promptly getting the most important information is crucial. Hence, using the power of ChatGPT to make your crypto journey more enjoyable is a wise move.

 But please note that using ChatGPT for crypto analysis is just one part of the puzzle. You shouldn't rely on ChatGPT for analysis because of its limited dataset and its well-documented issues with hallucination. Furthermore, nothing replaces the research you should do before investing any money in crypto!
