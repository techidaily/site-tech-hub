So you must know the Kindle battery life hours of each Kindle device to make your usage experience better. Combine your own habits, you will know when you have to charge your Kindle device.

**According to the user's feedback, Kindle battery life when you continuous using the Kindle device after one charge:**  
 For Kindle 2, the battery will last 30 hours. For Kindle 3/4, the battery will last 15 hours. For Kindle Basic, the battery will last 14 hours. For Kindle Fire, the battery will last 9 hours.

I think it's because of the Kindle Fire apps consuming more power. Of course, the wireless, lightness, usage, device settings, web browsing, and downloading content can influence the duration of the Kindle battery.
