There are a bulk of eBooks in the tablet or eReader. As usual, we try to manage our eBooks collections and classify them into different categories by themes or authors. If you would like to combine these serial fiction segments from the same author, how to merge these files into a single eBook? There is a free EpubMerge plugin for Calibre to help us combine ePub files with Calibre.

### What should we need?

What should we need before I show you how to merge multiple eBooks?

* Calibre
* EpubMerge Plugins
* EPUB DRM Removal

There is no need to worry about how to be proficient in conducting Calibre. You just follow this guide step by step. And make sure you have installed Calibre and imported the destination eBooks successfully.

This plugin offers users create new EPUB eBooks by merging **unDRMed EPUB format eBooks**. Firstly, we should import the Epub format eBooks into Calibre.

2Merge DRM-free EPUB eBooks

![merge epub files](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/merge-epub-eBooks.png)

In the next step, it will pop up a window called "Order EPUBs to Merge" to prompt you confirm the EPUB books which you want to merge. If there is an eBook which you don't want to combine, choose the book and press the "X" button to remove it with ease. If you check out all right, just press "OK" to confirm. Forget the pop-up window and press "OK" button. And it will pop up a metadata window before all ePub eBooks are merged. Generally speaking, the metadata is inherited from the first book in the merge list. Of course, you can set your custom metadata. Once all are right, please press "OK" to go on merging.

You can also restore the merge eBook to the original status. Let's select the incorporated ePub eBooks. Then go forward to the EpubMerge menu, choose the UnMerge Epub option. Now let's take a snap to split the merge eBook apart.

3Merge DRMed eBooks

 Thanks very much for the excellent Calibre software, it really helps me a lot ;-)  
 But now there's a problem: I'm using Epubmerge plugin to merge more than 4000 epub files, (total size &gt; 500.00MB) it reports: out of memory, and then exit...

 Because our netword limit, I cannot reach and register on the Mobileread website, cannot get help from the author of Epubmerge...

 Is there any other ways to merge more than 4000 epub files into one file, (total size &gt; 500.00MB)?

 Thanks again!

 Calibre 3.22.1  
 Win 10 pro  
  
 Could pls relpy to: honahlee@126.com?

The plugin doesn't work with ePUB3 files but only ePUB2.
