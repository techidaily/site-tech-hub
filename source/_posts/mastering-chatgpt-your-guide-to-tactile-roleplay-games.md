## Mastering Mobile Communication: Enable ChatGPT's Voice Control Functionality on Your Android Smartphone Today

 If you're an Android smartphone user looking for a powerful chatbot assistant that provides advanced features and can also work hands-free, look no further than VoiceGPT.

 The app allows you to control ChatGPT via voice commands. Not only can you record your query with voice input, but you can also use it to perform a variety of tasks within the ChatGPT interface, even when you're on the go. Let's take a closer look at how you can set up and use VoiceGPT on your Android device.

## What Is VoiceGPT?

 VoiceGPT is a multi-functional app that helps you access and control ChatGPT through voice commands. It can perform a wide range of functions, such as text extraction, email writing, or image generation (via DALL-E integration). We'll take a closer look at some of its functionalities in the sections below.

 You can use the app hands-free by setting up hotword activation. Say something like "Hey, Chat" to pull up the app easily. There's also an option to switch from Google Assistant to VoiceGPT as the default voice assistant for your device, but do note that the feature can be rather laggy.

 Though the free version of the app might look a bit clumsy with all the ads, it is easy to use and is great for anyone looking to simplify their daily tasks. There are lots of settings you can use within the app to get it working just how you want it, and it's available in multiple languages.

 To get started, download the app and enable hotword activation for voice inputs. Ads support the free version of the app, however, you have the option to sign up for a monthly subscription for an ad-free experience.

**Download:** [VoiceGPT](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026716/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gpt.voice.chatgpt) (Free, subscription available)

## How to Use Voice Input and Text-To-Speech Features With VoiceGPT

 With VoiceGPT, you can interact with and[control ChatGPT using your voice](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-control-chatgpt-with-voice/) , making the experience more natural and intuitive than ever before. The app utilizes text-to-speech and talk-back features to enable you to hear responses coming from the ChatGPT interface, providing a seamless and personalized conversational experience. Here's how to set this up:

1. On your device, launch the VoiceGPT app, and log in with your ChatGPT credentials.
2. To get started with voice inputs, click on the**mic** button in the bottom menu, and grant the required permissions.
3. Tap the**Home** icon and enable**Show InstaBubble** . This is a floating icon that helps you switch back and forth from the VoiceGPT app.
4. This will also enable the**Hey, Chat** hotword slider. Tap it to activate.
5. Once done, speak your query into the app—whatever you say will appear on the ChatGPT interface integrated with the app.
6. To set the mic to be automatically reactivated, toggle on**Auto Reactivate Microphone** .

 The talk-back feature is now automatically enabled and will read back the responses generated by ChatGPT. You can continue with your queries using voice inputs.

 Interestingly, you can also use VoiceGPT as the default device assistant if you want to quickly access the app itself. To do this, tap**Home > Settings > Set default Assistant** . This automatically opens up the device assistance settings—just choose**VoiceGPT** from the list of options available.

## How to Access a Database of Pre-Defined Prompts With VoiceGPT

1. To get started, tap the**three-line** icon in the bottom panel to bring up the**Prompts and Categories** page. Hit**Update Prompts** to refresh the entire list of prompts in the database.
2. Next, tap on any one of the categories and simply fill in the details of your prompt by typing it out or using your device's built-in voice typing feature.
3. Hit**Execute Prompt** to get relevant responses from ChatGPT.
