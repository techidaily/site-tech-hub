 Who said the Linux terminal is boring? Not when you have a list of fun Linux commands to run and have a chuckle. Whether you're just looking to kill some time or explore new Linux programs, these 10 commands will take you on an adventure into the world of Linux entertainment.

 All the commands we mention are available for most Linux distributions. You can follow the installation commands to get them working in your specific distro. For demonstration purposes, we'll be using the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS version.

##  1\. sl: Full Steam Ahead

![The sl command making a train run on your Linux terminal](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sl-command.png) 

 Speaking of adventures, did you know that you could run a locomotive train on your Linux terminal? That's what the sl command does. It creates a locomotive train that travels through your terminal window.

 To get this classic train on Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives, use:

sudo apt install sl

 Install it on RHEL, Fedora, and their derivatives with:

sudo yum install sl

 For Arch Linux and its derivatives, use:

sudo pacman -S sl

 To install it on openSUSE, run:

sudo zypper install sl 

 After installing sl, run the command like this:

sl

 You can also add some flags for different scenarios.

* \-a: An accident occurs, and the people inside ask for help
* \-l: Shows a smaller-sized train with more coaches
* \-F: The train starts flying in the sky
* \-e: Lets you stop the train animation using Ctrl+C

 If you're running [Arch Linux](https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-from-infinix-smart-7-hd-by-drfone-android/), you have a few more options.

* \-c: C51 appears instead of D51
* \-d: Activates disco mode. Color changes during the animation
* \-G: Displays a new modern train
* \-w: Train moves faster
* \-<Number>: Specify the number of coaches. For example, **sl -5** displays 5 coaches

 You can even make the train into a rainbow train if you [pipe](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-whatsapp-from-iphone-11-pro-to-other-iphone-11-pro-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios/) the sl command with lolcat, like this:

sl | lolcat

![A rainbow themed train running on your Linux terminal](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sl-command-with-lolcat.png) 

 So the next time you misspell the [ls command](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-capturecraft-hd-top-10-freepaid-filters-list/), you'll be greeted with a nice train instead of an error message.

##  2\. CMatrix: Enter the Matrix

![The cmatrix command making green characters raining on your Linux terminal like The Matrix movie](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cmatrix-command.png) 

 Ever wanted to feel like you're in a scene from "The Matrix" movie? This [Linux command](https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/misinterpretation-of-gram-staining-results-can-lead-to-incorrect-identification-affecting-treatment-decisions-in-clinical-settings/) turns your terminal into a cascading stream of green characters, much like the Matrix's digital rain.

 To get this hacker terminal effect on Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives, use:

sudo apt install cmatrix

 To install it on RHEL, Fedora, and derivatives, run:

sudo yum install cmatrix

 For Arch Linux and its derivatives, use:

sudo pacman -S cmatrix

 Install it on openSUSE with:

sudo zypper install cmatrix

 After installing the command, run it like this:

cmatrix

 Here are a few options you can try to make it more fun:

* \-a: Asynchronous scroll
* \-b: Bold characters on
* \-B: All bold characters
* \-o: Use old-style scrolling
* \-m: Every character becomes a lambda
* \-C <color>: Set a specific color instead of the default green. For example, **cmatrix -C blue** sets the character color blue

 After executing the command, you can tap some keyboard buttons to get various effects.

* a: Toggle asynchronous scroll
* b: Random bold characters
* B: All bold characters
* n: Turn off bold characters

 If you want to show off your inner hacking skills to your friends, run this command to surprise them with the slick Matrix effect.

##  3\. aafire: ASCII Art Fireworks

![ASCII firework animation running on your terminal](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aafire-command.png)

 The aafire command sets your terminal on fire. Okay, not literally. It launches a dazzling display of ASCII art fireworks across your terminal. It's a great way to create a virtual bonfire.

 To install aafire's virtual fire on Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives, use:

sudo apt install libaa-bin

 Get aafire on RHEL, Fedora, and their derivatives with:

sudo yum install aalib

 Install it on Arch Linux and its derivatives using:

##  4\. oneko: A Playful Desktop Pet

![Oneko cat running through the Linux terminal](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/oneko-command.png) 

 Here's one for cat lovers. This adorable pixel art cat will roam your desktop, play with toys, and even curl up for a quick nap.

 To get oneko's cute feline friend on Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives, use:

sudo apt install oneko

 Install the command on RHEL, Fedora, and their derivatives using:

sudo yum install oneko

 Get oneko on Arch Linux and its derivatives with:

sudo pacman -S oneko

 To install it on openSUSE, run:

sudo zypper install oneko

 After installing the command, run it like this:

oneko

 You can add a lot of options to the command for different characters.

* \-tora: The cat turns into a "toraneko", a cat with tiger-like stripes
* \-dog: Runs a dog instead of a cat
* \-sakura: Runs Sakura Kinomoto instead of a cat
* \-tomoyo: Runs Tomoyo Daidouji instead of a cat

 A virtual cat won't occupy space in your apartment or shed hair on your couch. Sounds purrfect.

##  5\. xeyes: Watch the Eyeballs

![Eyeballs following your mouse cursor](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/xeyes-command.png) 

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 A pair of eyes following you all the time? Spooky, right? The xeyes command makes that happen. These animated eyeballs will track your mouse cursor across the screen.

 To get these observing eyeballs on Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives, use:

sudo apt install x11-apps

 For RHEL, Fedora, and their derivatives, run:

sudo yum install xeyes

 Install it on Arch Linux and its derivatives with:

sudo pacman -S xeyes

 Get it on openSUSE with:

sudo zypper install xeyes

 After installing the command, run it like this:

xeyes

 Here are some options you can add with the command:

* \-fg <foreground color>: Choose a different color for the pupils of the eyes. For example, **xeyes -fg blue** turns the pupils into blue
* \-bg <background color>: Choose a different color for the background
* \-outline <outline color>: Choose a different color for the outline of the eyes
* \-center <center color>: Choose a different color for the center of the eyes

 This command not only adds a touch of surrealism to your screen but also provides an amusing reminder that even your desktop is watching you.

##  6\. espeak: Let Your Computer Speak Up

 Not feeling like reading text on your terminal? No problem. The espeak command enables your terminal to speak any text you input. This speech synthesizer command can read text files, pronounce individual words, and even change the voice and pitch of the output speech.

 Give speech powers to your terminal on Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives with:

sudo apt install espeak

 To install the command on RHEL, Fedora, and their derivatives, run:

sudo yum install espeak

 Get it on Arch Linux and its derivatives using:

sudo pacman -S espeak

 Install it on openSUSE with:

sudo zypper install espeak

 After installing the command, the most basic way to use it is in the below format:

espeak "<text>"

 Replace <text> with any other text and the terminal will read it out loud for you. Here's an example:

espeak "Hello World"

 Here are some useful options you can add to the command:

* \-f <text file>: Text file to speak
* \--stdin: Read text input from standard input instead of a file
* \-a <integer>: Amplitude, 0 to 20, default is 10\. For example, **espeak -a 15** sets the amplitude to 15
* \-p <integer>: Pitch adjustment, 0 to 99, default is 50
* \-s <integer>: Speed in words per minute, default is 160
* \-v <voice name>: Use the voice file of this name from the "espeak-data/voices" directory
* \-w <wave file name>: Write output to this WAV file, rather than speaking it directly
* \--stdout: Write speech output to stdout

 Giving a voice to your Linux terminal is like having a personal narrator on your desktop.

##  7\. yes: The Ultimate Affirmation

![The Linux terminal generating an infinite amount of yes yes yes text](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/yes-command.png) 

 The yes command infinitely repeats any text you throw at it. This can be useful in some scenarios where you need to automate creating files or feed the repeated text into some other commands.

 This command comes installed by default in most Linux distributions. You can install it on Debian and Ubuntu distributions with:

sudo apt-get install coreutils

 There are two common ways you can use the command on its own. You can simply enter the command like this:

yes

 This will output "y" infinitely until you terminate it using Ctrl+C. The other way is to add some text right after the command, like this:

yes <text>

 Replace <text> with any other text. Here's an example:

yes Linux is fun

 This command will keep displaying the text "Linux is fun" until you terminate it. Learn more about [how to use the yes command](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-asus-mg28uq-4k-monitor-review/).

##  8\. rig: Generate Virtual Identities

* q: Quit

 It's an aquatic way to add a touch of tranquility to your Linux world.
