Amazon rolled out AZW3 format in late 2011 along with the release of Kindle Fire Tablet. As the enhanced version of the standard AZW format, AZW3 format supports HTML5, CSS3 and some other advanced formatting capabilities. A large number of Kindle books purchased from Amazon are in AZW3 format. In our previous articles we’ve introduced [Top 5 AZW3 readers for Android](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/reader/) and [How to Read AZW3 Books on PC and Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). Here in this article I’m going to illustrate **how to read AZW3 books on iPad/iPhone** and introduce the **best AZW3 readers for iOS** if your AZW3 books are DRM free.

It’s universally known that AZW3 is the Amazon proprietary format and all AZW3 books delivered by Amazon have DRM encryption. Hence, the DRMed AZW3 books can only be read on Kindle related devices or apps. However, Kindle for iOS is not an option when it comes to reading AZW3 books on an iOS device. We’ve tested and found that AZW3 files cannot be read on Kindle for iOS but can be read on Kindle for Android. 

Then what apps on earth can read AZW3 books on an iPad or iPhone? To put it simply, there’re two ways to read AZW3 books on an iPad or iPhone. You can either install some 3rd party reader apps on your iOS device or read them with iBooks (now called Apple Books). I'll elaborate the two ways in details in the following parts of the article.

* [Read AZW3 books with iBooks (Now Called Books)](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Read AZW3 books with 3rd Party Reading Apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Prerequisites of reading AZW3 books on an iOS device

AZW3 is a format for Kindle eBooks that are downloaded from Kindle eReader devices (the firmware is not higher than 5.6.x.x) or downloaded directly from the Amazon website for the Kindle eReader. 

Traditionally AZW3 files do not work on Apple devices. But I can tell you some solutions to bypass the limitation, liberate your purchased AZW3 books, and allow you to read them on an Apple device. **The only prerequisite is you must [remove the DRM from the AZW3 books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)**. Without stripping DRM, the AZW3 books are locked by Amazon and are confined to be read on Kindle eInk readers, Kindle desktop app, and Kindle for Android.

I don’t want to brag about the magic tool, [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), but it does work like a charm!

As the most easy-to-use eBook DRM Removal and Format Converter, Epubor Ultimate only requires one-click to get things done.

### Method 1\. Read AZW3 books with iBooks (Now Called Books)

After removing DRM from your AZW3 books, you need to convert their formats to ePub or PDF which are compatible with iOS device, import the converted books into your iPhone or iPad, then you can read the epub or pdf files with iBooks. 

The following are the steps of decrypting AZW3 books and converting AZW3 to EPUB/PDF:

#### Step 1\. Install Epubor Ultimate on your computer

Once the conversion is done, you can see "Succeeded" at the end of the book tile. You can click "Succeeded" to open the output folder or click the "Folder" icon to open it.

**Heads up**: Please ensure the AZW3 books are purchased via your own Amazon account. The books must be associated with your Amazon account. Loaned books or books obtained from other sources cannot be supported by the program.

### Method 2\. Read AZW3 books with a 3rd Party Reading Apps

After removing DRM from your purchased AZW3 books with Epubor Ultimate, you can also install some 3rd party reading apps on your iPad/iPhone to read the DRM-free AZW3 books directly without converting the format.
