## Retrieve Hidden Credentials: A Guide to Access Stored Passwords in Edge Browser

It happens to the best of us: Sometimes, you can't remember the password to a website. Luckily, if you have previously chosen to save a password in Microsoft Edge, you can easily recover it on Windows 10, Windows 11, or a Mac. Here's how.

 First, open Edge. Click on the ellipses button (which looks like three horizontal dots) in the upper-right corner of any window. In the menu that appears, select "Settings."

![Click the three-dot menu icon, then click 'Settings.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1-8.png) 

 On the Settings screen, ensure you're on the "Profiles" tab, scroll down until you reach the section labeled Microsoft Wallet, then click "Passwords."

 On the Passwords screen, you will see a list of every website for which you've saved a username and password in Edge. Look through the list, find the website you want the password for, then click it.

 On both Windows and Mac, a box will pop up asking you to authenticate your system user account before the password can be shown. Enter the password (or PIN) you use to log into your computer and click "OK."

 After you enter your system account info, you'll see your username (or email, depending on how the website handles logins) and your password hidden with some asterisks. Click the small eye icon next to your password to reveal it.

 Do your best to memorize it while you can, but resist the urge to write it down on paper because other people may find it. If you typically have trouble managing passwords, it's usually better to [use a password manager instead](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/unlock-your-realme-gt-5-pro-phone-with-ease-the-3-best-lock-screen-removal-tools-by-drfone-android/).
