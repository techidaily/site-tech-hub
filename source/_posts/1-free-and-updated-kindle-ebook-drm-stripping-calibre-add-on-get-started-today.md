As we know, Kindle books we buy from Amazon are always protected by DRM. So we can't read those Kindle books on a Non-Kindle eReader or Kindle app. What's worse, we can't even share Kindle books with our families and friends. Though we have paid for our Kindle books, it seems that we don't truly own them. It's really a pain for eBook lovers, right? But how can we solve this problem? In fact, the best way is to remove DRM from Kindle books. In this article, I will show you a free Kindle DRM Removal--Calibre Plugin, which can help us remove Kindle DRM with ease.

* [Part 1\. Free Kindle DRM Removal: Calibre DeDRM Plugin](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Part 2\. A Much Better and Easier Way to Remove Kindle DRM-- Kindle DRM Removal Alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Free Kindle DRM Removal: Calibre DeDRM Plugin

#### Step 1\. Install Calibre and DeDRM plugin 

Before removing Kindle DRM with Calibre plugin, you need to install both Calibre and the DRM Removal Plugins first. If you have already done it, just skip this step.

Download: [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download)

Download: [DeDRM\_tools.zip](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM%5Ftools/releases/download/v10.0.9/DeDRM%5Ftools%5F10.0.9.zip)(v10.0.9)

The DeDRM\_tools.zip you download from Github should be unzipped. After you unzip it, you will get a file DeDRM\_plugin.zip which is exactly the file you should install to Calibre. Remember to install the DeDRM\_plugin.zip instead of the DeDRM\_tools.zip. 

![DeDRM plugin](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/dedrm-plugin-zip-file.png)

Then run Calibre, click "Preference" >> "Plugins" >> "Load flugin from file" >> add the DeDRM\_plugin.zip file to Calibre. Follow the procedure and you'll find the DeDRM plugin has been added under the "File Type" option.

![calibre DRM Removal Plugin](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/dedrm-location.png)

Note: You should also [install the kfx-input plugin](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) to calibre. 

After installing them successfully, it's time to remove Kindle DRM. 

#### Step 2\. Remove Kindle DRM With Calibre DeDRM Plugin 

1**Add books.** 

First, make sure you have downloaded your Kindle books to your computer. If not, there are 3 ways you can download them: 

(1) From Kindle for PC/Mac desktop app; 

(2) From Amazon official website. 

(3) From Kindle e-ink device. 

When the Kindle books are prepared, run Calibre, click "Add books" to upload your Kindle books (the .azw format file) to Calibre or just drag them to it. 

![add book to calibre](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/add-books.png)

2**Remove DRM from Kindle books**.

If your books are downloaded from Kindle desktop app, Amazon site or Kindle device, the DRM will be automatically removed when you upload books.

![](http://www.epubor.com/images/faq.png) FAQ: Failed to remove Kindle DRM with Calibre 

##### I cannot remove DRM from the Kindle books downloaded from Kindle for PC/Mac or from my Kindle device. Why? 

Ensure you've sucessfully installed the Calibre and plugins(both the dedrm plugin and the kfx-zip plugin), and then download your kindle books to computer via the latest Kindle PC or Mac. 

![](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/the-book-has-drm.png)

But please note that, the Calibre plugin won't detect your downloaded books. It means you must find the [kindle books location](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) first and then drag them to calibre library. If you added the incorrect book file, you may fail to dedrm your kindle books. 

Another fact is that the free kindle dedrm plugin won't work if Kindle for PC app updated to 2.4.1 (70946). You will get the error like "Failed to decrypt KFX DRM voucher with any key" and the imported kindle books are turned into KFX-ZIP format, still with drm protected.

Far, far too complicated. If a one-click drm removal that requires no serial number cannot be developed, why bother?

We just want to list all the options. It is for you to make the decision which method to choose. Different people may choose different methods.

Download the software for free, but it won't work (at all) until you buy a license. This is just deceptive marketing speech. It pisses me off to be lied to, and to have a company try and trick me. There is no way I would ever use or recommend your product.

 I will not reward dishonesty!

Thank you for your comments. The dedrm plugin is totally free. You can choose to use this free software.  
 For the Epubor Ultimate, it is the paid software with free trial version.

You should have been honest and said that it's not free. Very misleading.

And you can't call it a "free trial version" when you only give back 20 % of the text in the trial :(

Inside that zip file there's another zip file called "DeDRM\_plugin" without any version number. That's the one you're meant to add.

One detail that's missing from the instructions. If you're trying to back up your ebooks from your kindle then you need to customise the plugin and add your kindle's serial number. Then you download the ebooks from Amazon with the USB transfer option, and that will work.

hi - installed the DeDRM plugins successfully (I think) in Calibre (Mac) but it doesn't work.  
 If I add a DRM protected book into the Calibre library it says it cannot open it due to DRM protection.  
 Any ideas?  
 thanks

Las indicaciones que da el autor funcionan sin problema, solo hay que leer y seguir el procedimiento indicado, entre otras cosas por ejemplo: 1) instalar una version de KINDLE para PC anterior a 1.25 y 2) usar luego CALIBRE (con los complementos suministrados)para obtener el resultado buscado.

 Gracias!!!!
