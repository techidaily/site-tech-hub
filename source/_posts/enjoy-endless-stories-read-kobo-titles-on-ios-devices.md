Have you ever been tired of searching for how to read Kobo Books on the iPad? Because Kobo Inc (www.kobobooks.com) is lack of strong online support services such as an accessible support forum. Even though Kobo books adopt Kobo KEPUB DRM scheme, you still can't read Kobo books in the iPad with iBooks app directly. Because there is a mutual competition between Apple Inc and Adobe company. Here this guide will show you how to read Kobo eBook on the iOS devices (iPad, iPhone, iPod, etc).

### Kobo Books app for iPad

**What should we need before I show you how to read drm Kobo Books on iPad?** 

1\. Kobo app for iOS  
 2\. iBooks and iTunes  
 3\. Epubor Ultimate 

#### **1\. Kobo App for iPad**

[Download Kobo's eReading app](https://www.kobo.com/en/p/apps)from official website. This app allows you to share your reading life with your Facebook friends including notes and highlights.

**Pro:** It automatically syncs your highlights, annotations across iPad, iPhone and other devices. And the statistics and badges are interesting. All in all, Kobo App for iOS is a social reading and gamification. Most Kobo commercial eBooks adopt the scheme of Adobe DRM. Thus, the app supports reading the EPUB DRM eBooks and own DRM Kepub books. 

**Con:** If you learn from the official website, the Kobo app for iOS device such as iPad doesn't support in-app eBook purchasing. What's worse, it's not a possibility to import any eBooks directly from Kobo app. And you can't upload them to Kobo app for iPad or online.

#### **2\. Marvin for iPad**

Can we use the Adobe Digital Editions app for iPad to read Kobo eBooks? But there is no ADE app for iOS. Luckily, Adobe ePUB&PDF DRM Removal can help us remove drm from Kobo eBooks (DRMed EPUB and Kepub format). The Marvin for iPad app supports DRM-free epub format eBooks and allows you to add new books into the iPad via the built-in Dropbox. And you are now not subject to any restrictions because of protected Kobo books. 

**Pro:** This program helps you load Kobo epubs into iBooks without DRM restrictions. So you can transfer Kobo to iPad for enjoying in iBooks by iTunes library.

**Con:** To remove drm from eBook maybe break a law. In my eyes, this is a one-side understanding of this statement. The DMCA in the American allows a person to break a digital lock on the media.

So you can strip drm from eBooks including Kobo ePub books for personal usage.

##### Q1: How to buy books on Kobo app for iPad?

A: As we know, Apple has made the new rules that you can't buy any eBooks from Kobo apps and so on. Instead, we can only launch Safari web browser to purchase books from Kobo official website. In other words, you can only sync the eBooks which you have purchased to Kobo app for iPad.   
 As my test, the Kobo old app can be used to buy books directly if you don't upgrade to the new Kobo app edition.

##### Q2: How to transfer Kobo eBooks to iPad?

A: For Kobo users, maybe you have many eBooks on the desktop. But you can't find where they are. Go to Kobo website and redownload the eBooks to your computer again. Generally speaking, you can also download the Adobe DRM protected version eBooks from the Kobo website and save them on the computer desktop.   
 Now strip drm from these Kobo (Kepub and Adobe DRMed EPUB) eBooks, and click "Add to library" in the menu from iTunes library. When you import the books into iTunes library, just connect iPad to your computer. Go forward to iTunes and select what eBooks you want to sync. In the next step, tap the "Sync" button in the bottom right of the iTunes window. Just confirm the "Sync Books" button from the pop-up window. Finally, once you finish syncing the books, open iBooks on the iPad to enjoy your transferred Kobo eBooks. By the way, you can also read them with the Txtr, Bluefire, etc in the iPad when you download Adobe DRMed eBooks from Kobo website.  
 We can also send the Kobo books to iPad by email. Then open them by your favourite reading apps which support Kobo DRM.

##### Q3: How to delete books from kobo app on iPad?

A: Method 1: Go to Kobo.com and login. Launch the Kobo app and switch to "My library". Then select the books you want to remove by clicking the box next to the books title. And navigate to the top of the book list. You just need to tap "delete" button to confirm your removal act.   
 Method 2: Just press and hold on the book (icon or title) in the library view. Then confirm to remove books from library in the pop-up overview window.

##### Q4: If I download .acsm eBooks from Kobo.com, and how can I read acsm on iPad?

Firstly, ACSM is not an EPUB or PDF format eBook. ACSM is also short for Adobe Content Server Management. How to deal with an ACSM link? In fact, we can open this acsm by the authorized Adobe Digital Editions. Then the .acsm will be converted into PDF when you open it successfully. Unfortunately, as the first paragraph says, you can't transfer the DRM protected PDF book to iPad. Therefore, this guide will show you how to [convert ACSM to DRM-free PDF](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).
