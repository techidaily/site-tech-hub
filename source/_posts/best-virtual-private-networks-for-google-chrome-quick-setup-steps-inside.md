## Experience Unmatched Security: Try Our Best USA Virtual Private Networks Free Before You Buy

Using a**VPN** is completely legal in USA. If you’d like to protect your private data and information while surfing, or unblock some geo-restricted websites like Netflix in USA, you can use a VPN without any worries. But what VPN you can use? Below, we’ll show you**the best VPNs for USA** .

 You may already know that there are many VPNs for you to choose from on the market. So it’s not easy to find the best VPN. But don’t worry. You can choose a VPN depending on our review. To pick up the best VPNs, we’ve tried and reviewed many VPNs and referred to other VPN users’ opinions.

 Read on to get **[the four best VPNs we recommend for USA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ; just choose the best VPN according to your needs.

We pick the VPNs by comparing the following factors:

* **Servers**
* **Countries**
* **Download Speed**
* **Logging Policy**
* **Kill Switch Feature**
* **Stability**
* **Pricing**
* **Customer Service Support**

 In our opinion, the most important factors for a VPN are logging policy and privacy. So you can see all VPNs we pick have strict no logs policy, and have the kill switch feature.

**Strict no logs policy** means the VPN doesn’t keep logs of your private data and information. They won’t track the time or duration of any online session, and neither will they keep logs of your IP addresses or the servers used, websites visited or files downloaded. So they can’t provide any details about your behavior online, even if you request it yourself. This is to ensure your privacy is always safe and secure.

**Kill switch feature** is a feature which will disconnect you from the internet when your VPN connection stops working. If your VPN stops working, you will not being protected, then your private data and information will be leaked. To prevent your private data being leaked, some VPNs offer the kill switch feature to shut down the traffic as soon as your VPN connection stops working. This will maximize your privacy and anonymity.
