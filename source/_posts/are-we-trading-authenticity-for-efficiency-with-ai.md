 Chrome is undoubtedly one of the most powerful web browsers, but there’s much more you can accomplish with it—thanks to AI tools. From improving your search results to enhancing web applications, read on to find out brilliant ways to scale up your productivity online.

## 1\. ChatGPT for Google

 ChatGPT is an AI tool that has proven incredibly useful. It's a language model that produces fascinating results across a variety of fields of learning and interest.

 ChatGPT for Google is a Chrome extension that integrates ChatGPT’s insights into your search results. This means that once you launch a search on your Chrome browser, you'll see responses from ChatGPT on the side.
