Here are 3 of the most effective and efficient ways for you to do it. You don’t need to try them all; just pick whichever seems the easiest to you to get your computer turn on again.

1. **[From a hard reboot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[From settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1: From a hard reboot

 If you are**unable to boot** into Windows, please choose this option.

 We do not recommend you to precede this hard reboot option because restarting a computer without support of operating system could result in data loss, incomplete installations and suspension and corruption of any processes that were running before the reboot. Please do not try this when your computer is at a good state.

 1) Press and hold the power button on your computer until it powers off.

 2) Press the power button on your computer to turn it on.

 3) Repeat step 1) and 2) until you see**Please wait** during the boot. It usually takes three repeats (more than three repeats if this is not the first time that you did this) for it to come up. You need to try until you can see the**Please wait** coming out.
