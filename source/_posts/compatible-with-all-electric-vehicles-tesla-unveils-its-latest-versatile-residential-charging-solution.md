## Compatible with All Electric Vehicles: Tesla Unveils Its Latest Versatile Residential Charging Solution

Tesla has launched a new level 2 home charger called the Universal Wall Connector, and it's designed to charge all electric vehicles in North America. You don't need to buy or use adapters; the wall connector handles everything automatically.

 While the automaker released a [home charger for non-Tesla models](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-zoom-recordings-for-business-success/) late last year, one that could charge a Tesla with an adapter, its latest home wall charger takes advantage of the "Magic Dock" to work regardless of charge plug type. So, how does it work? The all-new Universal Wall Connector has the same hardware as Tesla's other home options, and can quickly charge any Tesla at Level 2 AC speeds (up to 44 miles of range per hour) with the typical Tesla plug (which is [slowly being adopted in other cars](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-track-imei-number-of-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-through-google-earth-by-drfone-android/)). However, those with any other EV can tap a different button while removing the charging cable, and it'll release from the magic dock with a J1772 connector, which will charge any North American EV at slower speeds.

 Even though the new Universal Wall Connector technically still uses an adapter of sorts to work with other electric vehicles, owners don't have to deal with any of it. Instead, the wall receptacle houses and handles everything for you. It's a pretty nifty way of doing things and is similar to how Tesla's [Supercharger Magic Docks](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/noskyshadowtool-premium-bg-elimination-software-for-2024/) around the globe can charge other models.

 Here's what to expect from the new Tesla Universal Wall Connector:

* Up to 44 mi of range added per hour at 11.5 kW / 48 amp output
* Integrated J1772 adapter to conveniently charge any electric vehicle
* Auto-sensing handle to open a Tesla charge port
* Monitor and manage your charging schedule and usage from the Tesla app
* Wi-Fi connectivity for over-the-air updates, remote diagnostics, and access controls
* Versatile indoor/outdoor design
* Variable amperage configurations depending on installation location
* Power-share with up to six Wall Connectors
* 24-foot cable length
* Four-year warranty for residential use

 This solution is perfect for multi-EV households and is a great way to future-proof things when customers install their first charger at home. It's essentially one charger to rule them all. More importantly, it'll only be [$595 when it starts shipping in October](https://shop.tesla.com/product/universal-wall-connector), making it relatively affordable compared to much of the competition.
