![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c19afef32a4d.png)

 If your SD card doesn‚Äôt appear in Windows File Explorer when you plug it into your PC‚Äôs card reader, don‚Äôt despair. This is a common Windows problem, and despite being very frustrating, it‚Äôs usually very easy to fix.

 Below is a list of the fixes that have worked for other Windows users. Start at the top of the list and work your way down until you find the fix that works for you.

 **Method 1:[Update your drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 2:[Clean your SD card & reader](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 3:[Check if your card reader is disabled](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 **Method 5:[Disable then enable card reader (from other users)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/resolvedsd-card-is-not-recognized-by-pc/#method5)**

---

## Method 1: Update your drivers

 The most common cause of an unrecognized SD card is a faulty, incorrect or outdated card reader driver. So the first thing you should do it check that your drivers are in good health. You can do this either manually or automatically:

**Manual driver update** ‚Äì You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer‚Äôs website and searching for the most recent correct driver. Note that for some drivers, you may need to try both the manufacturer of your PC and also the manufacturer of the card reader itself. If you don‚Äôt have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**Automatic driver update** ‚Äì Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your card reader. You don‚Äôt need to know exactly what system your computer is running or who your card reader‚Äôs manufacturer. Nor do you need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don‚Äôt need to worry about making a mistake when installing.  You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/scan-1200x840.jpg)

 3) Click the **Activate & Update** button next to all flagged devices to automatically download and install the correct version of their drivers. Pay close attention to whether your card reader appears in the list.

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You‚Äôll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this ‚Äì when you select Update All, you‚Äôll get a prompt to upgrade. If you‚Äôre not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation. No charges will occur until after your 7-day trial period ends.).

 If your card still isn‚Äôt working after updating your drivers, move onto[Method 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Method 2: Clean your SD card & reader

 Another very common cause of an unrecognized SD card is a very simple one: a dirty SD card or a dusty card reader. Either will cause a poor contact between card and reader.

 So the second thing you should do is give your card a clean, and remove any dust from the reader, then try the card again.

* To clean your card, dip a cotton cloth in a little alcohol or water, and lightly wipe the dirty area, paying particular attention to the metal contacts.
* To clean your reader, use a compressed air device to blow the dust out of the reader. Alternatively, you can buy contact cleaner on Amazon, which you can use to clean the reader.

 If the card still doesn‚Äôt work, move onto[Method 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Method 3: Check if your card reader is disabled

 If you‚Äôve tried methods 1 and 2, and your PC still isn‚Äôt recognizing your SD card, it‚Äôs possible your card reader is turned off in your BIOS.

 To check, restart your PC, and at the splash screen (the first screen you see after restarting), look for an instruction that tells you to press a certain key on your keyboard to enter your ‚ÄúBIOS‚Äù or ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù (e.g. F2 or Delete). Every motherboard manufacturer has their own unique BIOS with its own keyboard shortcut, so we can‚Äôt say exactly which key to press to get in.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a051c4cb26bf.jpg)

 Likewise all manufacturers organize their BIOS settings their own way; there‚Äôs no standard way of doing it. So we can‚Äôt tell you exactly what setting to change, and how to find that setting. But once you‚Äôre in the BIOS, it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find the ‚Äòon/off‚Äô switch for your card reader. Just look for a section related to devices or storage, and within that section look for something like ‚ÄúSD Reader‚Äù or ‚ÄúCard Reader‚Äù. Enable that setting if it‚Äôs not already enabled, then save and exit the BIOS. (Be sure to save as you exit. Some manufacturers make it very easy to leave the BIOS without saving your changes, and if you do, you won‚Äôt have changed anything.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a051c7dcd812.jpg)

 Once your computer has restarted and you‚Äôve logged into Windows, test your card again. If it‚Äôs still not recognized, move onto[Method 4](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Method 4: Test your SD card in another PC

 If your SD card is faulty, your PC won‚Äôt recognize it. To check, you‚Äôll need to locate another PC with a card reader, and test your SD card in that computer, to see if it works.

 If your SD card doesn‚Äôt work in the other PC either, it‚Äôs probably faulty, and you‚Äôll need to replace it.

 If it_does_ work in the other computer, then it‚Äôs not a faulty card, but it may be that your card reader is faulty.

## Method 5: Disable then enable card reader (from other users)

 Thanks Alan Darlington for sharing this method, which has worked for many users. So if your SD card is still not showing up on your PC, try this method.

 QuoteAlan Darlington‚Äôs words:

 ‚ÄúEasy solution for me: ASUS X551C, Win10, 16G SD:  
 Go to device manager as above ‚Äî when I do it there is no SD Host Adapters but there is Memory Technology Devices under which there is RealteK PCIE Card reader. Select this then click Driver then on the Disable, acknowledge the popup, then back at the driver screen click on the Enable and its popup ‚Äî the SD card now appears as it did previously & is accessable.  
 Don‚Äôt know why this works but it did for me.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre not sure how to do that, refer steps below:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Win+R** (**Windows logo** key and**R** key) at the same time to invoke the run box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc** in the run box and click**OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Expand category ‚Äú**Memory Technology Devices** ‚Äú. Double-click the card reader (In Alan‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs RealteK PCIE CardaReader. In your case, it may be different.) to open

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) Go to**Driver** tab. Click**Disable Device** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 5) When prompted to disable the device, click**Yes** .

 6) Double-click the card reader to open the Properties windows. Click**Enable Device** to re-enable the device.
