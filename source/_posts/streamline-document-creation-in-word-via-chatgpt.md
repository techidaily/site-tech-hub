* Ask for clarification if any steps are unclear.

### Example Prompts

 Our fast-paced environment has changed how we get therapy and emotional support. Virtual tools like ChatGPT can easily act as therapists, offering support, advice, and listening ears. ChatGPT can provide a space for safe expression and self-reflection without judgment or stigma.

### Tips

* Be honest. Your chats will only be stored on the ChatGPT server and can easily be deleted.
* Use open-ended questions to get the best responses.
* Define your problem clearly.

 While ChatGPT can act as a virtual therapist, it cannot replace actual therapy. Always opt for qualified mental health experts who can provide the right care and support for serious mental health concerns and crises.

2. Add context or ask questions to refine your search.

### Example Prompts

* What are the symptoms and treatments for a common cold?
* What is the history of the Eiffel Tower?
* How do I teach my puppy to sit?

 Always fact-check. Currently, ChatGPT's responses may be based on inaccurate or biased training data, so refer to credible sources to confirm any information received from ChatGPT.
