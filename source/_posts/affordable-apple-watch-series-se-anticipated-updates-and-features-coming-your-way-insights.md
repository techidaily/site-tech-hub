## IOS 18 Unveiled: Exploring New AI Features for iPhone Owners and Anticipating Upcoming Innovations | Tech Insights

![Apple iPhone 16 AI Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/ac6443a8864f7826f4f08ca3612dae9fe9cbb9b4/2024/09/09/43968368-1e95-45d0-8eb1-ff138d287c07/dsc01879.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

At its ["Glowtime" iPhone event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-at-iphone-16-event-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-ai-more/) last week, Apple confirmed that its AI-powered [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/) won't be arriving [until October](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-delivers-on-hardware-upgrades-but-punts-apple-intelligence-rollout/). Though some people have been able to test a few upcoming features via the [developer betas](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-arrives-in-ios-18-1-developer-beta-heres-whats-new-for-iphone/) of iOS/iPadOS 18.1 and MacOS Sequoia 15.1, most Apple users will have to wait a few more weeks.

**Also: [Every iPhone model that can receive Apple's iOS 18 update (and which ones won't)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-receive-apples-ios-18-update-and-which-ones-wont/)**

Even then, you'll need the right type of device. On the iPhone side, that means an [iPhone 15 Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPhone-15-Pro-Titanium%2Fdp%2FB0CMZ5LT14%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cb0e59408-ae69-42f7-a1ec-e3409d33f9e9%7Cdtp&dtb=1), [iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max%2Fdp%2FB0CMZD7VCV%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cb0e59408-ae69-42f7-a1ec-e3409d33f9e9%7Cdtp&dtb=1), [iPhone 16](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-16%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [iPhone 16 Plus](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [iPhone 16 Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-16-pro%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), or an [iPhone 16 Pro Max](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). iPad owners will need an [iPad Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) or [iPad Air](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-air&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) with an M1 chip and later. And on the Mac end, you'll need a [MacBook Air](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air%2F13-inch-m2&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [MacBook Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F14-inch&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [iMac](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [Mac mini](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), or Mac Studio with an M1 or later or a Mac Pro M2 Ultra.

Further, Apple Intelligence is going to be a work in progress. Yes, several of the core AI tricks will pop up in October. But others won't arrive until later this year or next year. For example, iOS/iPadOS 18.2 will reportedly launch in December with additional AI features.

**Also: [I went hands-on with Apple's standard iPhone 16 and didn't envy the Pro models at all](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-apples-standard-iphone-16-and-didnt-envy-the-pro-models-at-all/)**

Around the world, Apple Intelligence will first launch in US English and then expand to localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK in December. Support for more languages, such as Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish, will roll out next year.

For now, here are the new AI-powered skills you can expect next month with [iOS 18.1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-beta-adds-photo-clean-up-ai-tool-and-notification-summaries-how-they-work/), [iPadOS 18.1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/4-major-ipados-18-features-announced-at-wwdc-2024-and-which-ipads-will-get-it/), and [MacOS Sequoia 15.1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-download-macos-15-sequoia-beta-on-your-macbook-or-mac-right-now-heres-how/).

## 1\. Writing tools

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

Using Apple Intelligence, you'll be able to fine-tune your writing in Mail, Notes, Pages, and any supported third-party app. Like other AI-powered editing tools, Apple Intelligence will be able to rewrite, proofread, and summarize your text.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## 2\. Photo features

Apple Intelligence will tap into your photos for a few different tricks. You'll be able to create movies out of photos in your library just by typing a description of what you want to see, much like you would for a [chatbot prompt](https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ways-to-write-better-chatgpt-prompts-and-get-the-results-you-want-faster/). Using natural language, you'll be able to search for specific photos and even find certain moments in a video. 

The [new Clean Up tool](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-beta-adds-photo-clean-up-ai-tool-and-notification-summaries-how-they-work/) will help you remove distracting or unwanted elements in a photo while leaving everything else intact.

## 3\. Audio transcriptions

Using the Notes and Phone apps, you'll be able to [record, transcribe, and summarize a call](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-ios-18-will-let-you-record-phone-calls-without-a-third-party-app/) and other types of audio. When you start recording, the feature notifies everyone that the call is being recorded. Once the call ends, Apple Intelligence will not only transcribe it but summarize all its key points.

#### Newsletters

ZDNET Tech Today

ZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.

## 4\. Notification assistance

Instead of having to read all the notifications that appear on your screen, you'll be able to browse through AI-generated summaries of them. Plus, a new Focus mode will display only the notifications that need your immediate attention.

## 5\. Mail assistance

To help you get through your emails, Apple Intelligence will [try to understand their content](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-beta-adds-photo-clean-up-ai-tool-and-notification-summaries-how-they-work/) and identify those that are time-sensitive. Any emails that fit the criteria will be treated as priority messages. Instead of just previewing the first few lines of an email, AI will summarize the key details. 

**Also: [The iPhone 16 is undeniably great hardware - but you should still probably skip it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-16-is-undeniably-great-hardware-but-you-should-still-probably-skip-it/)**

Plus, a new Smart Reply feature will offer suggestions for quick replies and ensure that all the questions in a response have been addressed.

## 6\. Siri improvements

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

iPhone users who have suffered the many faults and foibles of Siri are undoubtedly hoping for [major improvements](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-will-improve-siri-in-2024-but-dont-expect-most-updates-until-2025/) to the voice assistant. With Apple Intelligence, Apple [promises](https://www.apple.com/gw/newsroom/2024/09/apple-intelligence-comes-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-starting-next-month/) that Siri will become more "natural, flexible, and deeply integrated" into the system.

On the visual front, Siri's familiar orb will be replaced by a glowing light that wraps around the end of the screen when you trigger the assistant on an iPhone or iPad or in CarPlay. Mac users will be able to place Siri anywhere on the screen so it's readily available.

**Also: [The 7 best iOS 18 features that will make updating your iPhone worthwhile](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-7-best-ios-18-features-that-will-make-updating-your-iphone-worthwhile/)**

Beyond using your voice to chat with Siri, you'll also be able to type your requests or questions. You can even switch between text and voice as you interact with Siri. The voice assistant will be able to follow and understand your words even if you make a mistake or stumble. Futher, Siri will be packed with knowledge about Apple's many devices, so it will be able to help you find and use all the features and settings on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac -- like an on-device Genius helper. 

Those are a fair number of AI-powered features and upgrades, but Apple Intelligence has more in store for the months and years ahead.

### Image playground

Using the AI-powered [Image Playground](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/), you'll be able to generate images based on a description, suggestions, or even a person from one of your photos. You can then tweak the style and make other changes based on how you plan to use or share the image.

### Image wand

The [image wand](https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-dall-e-apples-new-ai-image-generator-runs-on-device-and-works-like-magic/) will attempt to turn rough sketches into full images. When you circle an empty area on a virtual canvas or other screen, the image wand will generate an image based on the surrounding area.

### Genmoji

You'll be able to [create new emojis](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-generated-genmoji-solve-a-problem-weve-all-had-before/) on-demand by entering a description or selecting a photo of you or another person. In response, the AI will generate a more accurate and lively kind of emoji.

### More Siri tricks

Down the road, Apple will release more enhancements for Siri. The assistant is due to get onscreen awareness, which means it will be able to react based on your current screen and information. You'll also be able to access the expertise of [ChatGPT through Siri](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-announces-new-openai-iphone-features-at-wwdc/) \-- securely, with your consent -- to perform more complex AI-related tasks.

**Also: [Every iPhone model that will be updated to Apple's iOS 18 (and which ones won't)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/)**

The big question, though, is not so much when the new AI features will arrive but how well they will work. Compared to the likes of Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, Apple is behind in the AI arena and has much catching up to do. Plus, those of us who've been frustrated with Siri are expecting meaningful improvements to the voice assistant. If Apple can pull off its AI efforts and truly make a difference for its users, then the wait will have been worth it.
