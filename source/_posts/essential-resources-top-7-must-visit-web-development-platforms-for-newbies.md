## Essential Resources: Top 7 Must-Visit Web Development Platforms for Newbies

Getting into web development seems like a massive undertaking because there's just so much to learn, but don't panic. These seven sites have comprehensive coverage of the things you need to know.

## 1  W3 Schools

[W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is where I first started learning web development, and it's excellent at helping people progress quickly from the early stages of their learning to intermediate developers. The "Try It Yourself" function is one of the best things for new coders, allowing you to try out code in the middle of a tutorial. Since it's a web-based interface you can interact with it from anywhere, even through your phone. The site covers [HTML](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/possible-solutions-to-restore-deleted-call-logs-from-infinix-smart-7-hd-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/), CSS, and JavaScript through step-by-step tutorials.

 If you're new to front-end development, this is probably the best site to get your feet wet. The tutorials aren't overwhelming, and they focus on a single useful thing you need to learn.

## 2  MDN Web Docs 

![MDN Web Docs landing page](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mdn-web-docs.png) 

Jason Dookeran/How-to-Geek

[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is an excellent example of a [Free and Open-Source (FOSS)](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-leveraging-social-media-power-optimal-use-of-hash-tags-on-fb/) platform. You can access HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation and examples on a well-organized website. Among the tools the site offers are an interactive code playground and extensive [API documentation](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-unsung-free-speech-to-text-apps-for-your-mac/). A community of developers consistently updates it.

 If you're new to coding and are more inclined to using documentation because it has examples, MDN Web Docs might be a great utility for you to use. It isn't designed for brand new developers, however, so this might be one of those resources you keep for when you already have a solid grasp of front-end basics.

## 3  freeCodeCamp

Jason Dookeran/How-to-Geek

 If you enjoy real-world challenges, [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is the best place to start. The comprehensive, free curriculum covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [Node.js](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/download-latest-sound-card-drivers-compatible-with-windows-os/), and [React](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-you-unlock-your-iphone-15-learn-all-4-methods-drfone-by-drfone-ios/), among other things. The site's community nature makes it easy to learn from others and ask questions in an accepting and understanding environment. Because of how flexible the site is, you aren't limited to one area of learning. So, for example, you could start working on HTML, then once you've gotten competent with that, you could jump over to CSS or JavaScript and start learning those languages. It's by far one of the most flexible places for learning front-end development and it's super user-friendly.

## 4  Stack Overflow 

![stackOverflow landing page](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/stackoverflow.png) 

Jason Dookeran/How-to-Geek

 One of the most popular places on the internet to see example blocks of code is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). While there are no structured lessons here, you can get a glimpse into people with similar problems and get answers that might work for their individual projects. Both beginners and experienced developers use Stack Overflow to help them solve problems. A lot of the code that I have in some of my projects were adapted from working code from Stack Overflow.

 Since it's something of a forum, you can even ask your own questions there, but you should only do so if you're sure it hasn't been asked and answered already. It's a great resource for developers who have grasped the basic concepts of front-end development and are trying to solve specific problems on their own.

EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows. Both native 64-bit and 32-bit builds are available, and moreover, the 64-bit includes separate builds for SSE2 (128-bit), AVX-2 (256-bit), and AVX-512 (512-bit) instruction sets. New versions support AI-assisted writing.</a>

## 5  CSS-Tricks 

![Css-Tricks landing page](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/css-tricks.png) 

Jason Dookeran/How-to-Geek

[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) is a valuable resource if you're planning on coding CSS. The site has many tips and tricks on everything from basic CSS layouts to animations and more advanced techniques. The in-depth articles are approachable, making it easy for even beginners to get their feet wet and understand what's being explained. The articles are littered with live demos and code snippets that you can copy directly. It's also constantly updated, so it follows all the current trends in CSS development.

 The site is a lot take in, so if you're completely new to web development, it's easy to be overwhelmed. Don't panic, though. Most of what you want is likely to be under the "Articles" tab which is usually updated daily. There's a handy tag-sorter at the top to narrow down what you're looking for. If you have a specific CSS problem you want to solve, this gives you a great starting point for solving your problem. It won't walk you through CSS from beginner to intermediate, though!

## 6  Frontend Mentor 

![Frontend Mentor landing page](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/frontend-mentor.png) 

Jason Dookeran/How-to-Geek

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) might be an excellent solution if you're a learner who likes tackling challenges. The site offers a set of real-world challenges covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Moreover, it is a fantastic way for a new coder to build a portfolio of projects. Users also benefit from professional design guides and style files, allowing them to focus on the coding aspect. The active community is also great for feedback and spotting things you can improve.

 The website has a few "development paths" that can guide you through the very basics of development. You'll learn everything from JavaScript Fundamentals to front-end testing, giving you a solid basis to build on. Once you've completed those, you can move on to the challenges. Specific solutions for front-end problems can be found under the articles section of the site.

## 7  The Odin Project 

![The Odin Project landing page](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/the-odin-project.png) 

Jason Dookeran/How-to-Geek

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is one of the best places for beginners to get a comprehensive web development education. It covers front-end development and has a robust back-end curriculum. You can start with the Foundations section and then branch out to JavaScript or Ruby full-stack development. The Odin Project is among the best ways for beginners to get into JavaScript or Ruby.

 Ruby itself is an in-demand but underutilized front-end language. The Odin Project is one of the few places where you can get a foundational course that teaches you all you need to know about it. Both of these courses also give you insight into the basics of HTML and CSS, although they keep that information limited to what's relevant for learning either of these languages. The basics give you enough of a platform to explore on your own, by visiting other sites, like W3 Schools mentioned above.

## 8  It's Always Best to Have Multiple Resources 

 When learning to code, there's no one place that's the best. Programmers know that you might not find everything you need on a single site, so they refer to a few of them to get information and insight. These seven are only some of the sites out there from which coders can draw inspiration. You'll probably come across a lot more in your journey as a programmer.
