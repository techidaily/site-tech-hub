[Free Trial Activation](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/12/2019 3:42:41 PM 

The website says that there is a 30 day free trial, but the program asks for a registration code. How can I try before buying?

[Unsupported DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/16/2016 11:27:23 PM 

I download DRM removal for free trial and want to decrypt some EPUB files, when I drag them to the software, most of them are decrypted, but only the rest one failed and I get the error message "your book is protected by a kind of DRM we do not support". 

 It's strange. I can read all of them via Adobe Digital Editions. Anyone knows how to fix this problem?

[Kindle app requires update to view content](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/26/2023 5:14:25 AM 

I borrowed 2 books and when I attempt to open them in the Kindle app for PC I get this message: Your kindle app requires an update to view this content. Click here to download and install the free update.   
 I borrowed other books and they open just fine and I can use Epubor Ultimate to convert them.  
 Has Amazon changed file types or what? Any ideas?  
 Thanks

[Are there any websites that sell DRM-free Japanese e-books?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/20/2018 12:00:17 PM 

I'm familiar with the Japanese e-book stores like Kindle, honto.jp, and Kobo, but all of their books seem to have DRM, and none of them allow you to read books on your computer. Are there any bookstores that sell DRM-free e-books in Japanese?

[eBook conversion failed](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/18/2016 3:06:12 AM 

I used the free trial today to convert my epub books to mobi, all was working well. It worked for about another 80 books but now just keeps coming up with a 'failed' message beside the book whenever I try to convert the format.

[Free trial?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/14/2019 3:27:54 AM 

I was looking to test the epubor product by converting an .aax file to mp3\. It only converted 10 minutes, which is understandable under a free trial basis. However, I need to know how it will parse a 10 hour audio book .aax. Will it break it up into 10 minute segments? Will it break it up into chapters as audible does? What??

[Free trial needs paid license?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/8/2021 3:29:22 AM 

Hello. I just downloaded a free trial for Mac and tested on a Kindle book. It opens with the message: "Please register the software, then get all contents and the valid ebook format."

 Can I register without first paying?  
 If I like the software I would buy the Lifetime License but want to be sure first.  
 Thank you.

[Free trial limit the number of page to convert to 40?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/25/2020 3:47:15 AM 

Hi,

 I just wanted to try your converter for an ebook I uploaded from Amazon via Kindle for PC (Version 1.24 as you were suggesting).  
 It worked but only for 40 pages, despite the fact the book as many more pages (that I can access on Kindle in the Cloud)!  
 My question: Is it a normal limitation or is there a problem Or I did somethgn wrong? 

 Best regards  
 Axel.  

[Am I free??](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/28/2019 1:09:25 PM 

I want to make sure I’m not paying for epubor ultimate. Back in December I signed up for the free trial version (30 days). I do not remember giving my credit card information (though my memory may be playing tricks on me). I expected the program to stop working after 30 days, but it didn’t. Since this happened 8 months ago, I don’t remember the steps I took to install the program. How can I know if Epubor is charging me for using this program? Everything works just fine, which is highly suspicious. Every time I open it, a window asking for my registration code pops up, but I just close it and use the program. Does this window pops up for those of you who have payed for Epubor? Also, the program (in the configurations part) says that I’m licensed to a free trial. I guess it should have my email there if I had paid for this.  
 Maybe I’m being paranoid. Help??

[free trial](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/19/2019 8:13:13 PM 

You are supposed to have a free trial (?) because Im not paying for something until Im sure it works  
 Thanks
