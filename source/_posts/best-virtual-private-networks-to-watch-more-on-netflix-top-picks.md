## Best Virtual Private Networks to Watch More on Netflix - Top Picks

## Why do you need a VPN for Netflix?

 If you want to watch Netflix shows while you’re traveling overseas or you want to watch Netflix shows in other countries, you’ll need a VPN. Even if you don’t have the above requirements, a VPN can provide you with a better video streaming experience.

 Netflix has made agreements with other media companies to supply movies and TV in specific markets. Therefore, you can only view the show in the country where you created your account. A VPN can help you get around this limitation, but you need to know that Netflix doesn’t want you to do so. It will be your own risk.

 After knowing these, let’s take a look at how to choose a VPN for Netflix.

## How to choose a VPN for Netflix

* **Speed**
* **Safety**
* **Server coverage**

 Above are the three major factors that come to your priorities. In this article, we recommend using VPNs with security, fast download speed, wide coverage and runs on almost any platform. Most VPNs with these requirements are paid VPNs.  
 Although there are thousands of free VPNs online, almost all of them are limited in traffic, connections, device support, advertisements, etc. Everyone wants free stuff, it’s obvious that limited resources can’t support a large number of free users for a long time. That’s why we don’t recommend using a free VPN.
