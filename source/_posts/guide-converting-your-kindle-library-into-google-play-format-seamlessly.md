Amazon Kindle is the biggest eBooks store in the world, and Google Play Books is the first choice to read books on your android device. So, many people may ask, is there any way to transfer books from Amazon Kindle to Google Play Books APP? Because nobody wants to have too many apps to read ebooks, it's very inconvenient. They would rather have all books in one place, in one APP.

But normally, it's not easy to accomplish this goal, since Amazon and Google are two giant companies, they both want to lock customers to buy books from their own stores, so they set some restrictions to limit readers reading books and transfer ebooks to each other freely. But don't worry, this guide will teach you how to transfer Kindle books to Google Play Books step-by-step.

It has three steps, and if your are familiar with this process later, it will only take you less than 10 minutes to do it.

Would have been nice to know up front that the converter is NOT FREE, it will only convert 2 full books.

Epubor software only helps you remove drm and convert ebook format. As for uploading ebooks to google books, it is beyond our expertise. Thank you for your understanding.
