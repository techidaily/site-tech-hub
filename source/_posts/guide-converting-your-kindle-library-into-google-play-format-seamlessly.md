Amazon Kindle is the biggest eBooks store in the world, and Google Play Books is the first choice to read books on your android device. So, many people may ask, is there any way to transfer books from Amazon Kindle to Google Play Books APP? Because nobody wants to have too many apps to read ebooks, it's very inconvenient. They would rather have all books in one place, in one APP.

But normally, it's not easy to accomplish this goal, since Amazon and Google are two giant companies, they both want to lock customers to buy books from their own stores, so they set some restrictions to limit readers reading books and transfer ebooks to each other freely. But don't worry, this guide will teach you how to transfer Kindle books to Google Play Books step-by-step.

It has three steps, and if your are familiar with this process later, it will only take you less than 10 minutes to do it.

Go to Amazon website, **download Kindle for PC or Kindle for Mac app**, this app is used to download and read Kindle books on your computer, no matter you have a Kindle device or not, through this app, you can sync all your Kindle books to computer, such as books from Kindle eReader, Kindle fire or Kindle for android/iPhone/iPad app, Amazon Kindle store.

After downloaded and installed Kindle for PC or Mac app, please open it on your computer. If this is the first time you run it, it will ask you to sign in, **just type your amazon account** in the window.

And then, you will see your Kindle library.

After all your books have been downloaded to your computer, we can move to the next step.

There are three ways to upload books to Google Play Books, from computer's web browser, from your android device, from iPhone or iPad. Here I take [upload books from computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) as example (this way is also suggested by Google).

Fisrt, go to [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/books/uploads), on the top right side, there is a "Upload files" button, Click it. A window will pop up, you can upload the converted ePub books from your computer now. Notice google also supports uploading books from Google Drive.

Would have been nice to know up front that the converter is NOT FREE, it will only convert 2 full books.

Epubor software only helps you remove drm and convert ebook format. As for uploading ebooks to google books, it is beyond our expertise. Thank you for your understanding.
