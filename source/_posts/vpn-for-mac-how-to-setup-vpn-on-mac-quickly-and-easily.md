## [SOLVED] How to Configure VPN on Android | Quickly & Easily

**Are you wondering whether you should use VPN on your Android phone or not?**

 If you want to have a secure network connection on your Android device, or if you need to access some Geo-blocking content, or if you want to speed up connection when gaming or surfing the Internet on your Android phone, the answer is**YES** .

 All these issues can be resolved after you configure a VPN connection to the Internet on your Android phone.

## What is VPN?

**VPN (Virtual Personal Network)** is a type of connection you can use to secure your identity and protect your personal information when surfing the Internet. VPN creates a secure “tube” to connect your Android device to the Internet, which means all the activities on your Android device will be encrypted. So hackers cannot steal your personal information, and your privacy also won’t be revealed to your government and your ISP (Internet Service Provider).
