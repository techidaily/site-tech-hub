##  Modify the Power Plan Settings

 Link State Power Management is a feature on your Windows computer that saves battery life by controlling the connection between the [CPU](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/echoes-of-now-strategies-for-downloading-current-events/) and devices connected through the PCI Express (PCIe) slots. It works alongside Active State Power Management (ASPM) and offers three modes to configure — "Off," "Moderate Power Savings," and "Maximum Power Savings."

 If you select the "Off" option, your device won't save power. If you choose the "Moderate Power Savings" option, your laptop will conserve less energy and wake from the Sleep state more quickly. If you select the "Maximum Power Savings" option, you'll get the most battery savings, but it'll take comparatively more time to wake from Sleep.

 Since you want to maximize your laptop's battery life, you should select the "Maximum Power Savings" option. To do this, open the [Control Panel](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/1722861107683-troubleshooting-when-your-iphone-doesnt-ring-easy-fixes-inside/) and navigate to System and Security > Power Options > Change Plan Settings > Change Advanced Power Settings.

 Click "Apply" and "OK" to save the changes. After that, restart your laptop to see the impact on battery performance.

##  Change Video Playback Settings

 Many [UWP apps and third-party applications](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-plant-and-play-best-friends-games-in-the-agricultural-world/) use the video platform built into Windows 11\. You can control the video playback settings for these apps when your device is on battery to reduce battery consumption compared to before.

 To do that, [open the Settings app](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/affordable-laptop-friendly-software-for-dvd-viewing/), choose "Apps" from the left sidebar, and select "Video Playback" on the right.

##  Apply the Energy Recommendations Changes

 Windows 11 has an Energy recommendations option in the Settings menu that shows all the minor changes you can make on your device to [improve battery life](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-the-art-of-virtual-board-usage-in-web-conferences-android-apple-and-pc/). To apply these changes, open the Settings app, select "System" from the left sidebar, and click "Power & Battery" on the right.

##  Configure Unnecessary Apps to Use Less Powerful GPU

 In Windows, you can manually choose which [GPU](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/unlock-vivo-s17-pro-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/) an application uses. This can be helpful because there's no reason to use a powerful GPU for simple tasks like the Calculator app. Using the powerful GPU for such tasks would put more strain on your computer and drain your battery faster.

 This only applies to laptops with a GPU integrated into the CPU and a dedicated GPU. 

 You need to manually configure less resource-demanding applications to avoid using the powerful GPU and start using the other GPU instead. To do that, launch the Settings app and navigate to System > Display > Graphics.

![Graphics option in the Settings app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/graphics-option-in-the-settings-app.jpg)

##  Disable the RGB Lighting

 If your laptop has a backlit keyboard or you have an external keyboard with RGB lighting attached, you can improve your battery life by [disabling the RGB lighting](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-getting-started-with-your-new-youtube-premium-account-for-2024/). Different laptop and keyboard brands use different key combinations to turn off the lighting.

 For example, on my HP laptop, I can disable the keyboard backlight by pressing the Fn+F5 keys together. If you're unsure of the key combination for your device, you can check the user manual that came with your laptop.

##  Switch to the Dark Mode

[Switching to dark mode](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/new-from-beginner-to-pro-6-adobe-premiere-tips-to-transform-your-video-editing/) on your Windows 11 laptop can help improve battery life, but the increase won't be as significant as other tips in this article. Specifically, you can expect a 2-3% increase in battery life after switching to dark mode, and even that increase depends on your laptop screen. If your laptop has an [OLED screen](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/complete-guide-for-recovering-messages-files-on-tecno-phantom-v-flip-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/), you'll see that 2-3% battery life boost. However, if it's an LCD screen, the percentage will be even lower.

 This is because an LCD screen uses a backlight to illuminate the entire screen, regardless of the color displayed. Therefore, enabling dark mode will have a negligible impact. On the other hand, OLED screens have pixels that produce their own light and when you switch to dark mode the black pixel get turned off by default. Since the display doesn't need to light up those pixels, it uses less battery compared to light mode. However, keep in mind that the impact will still be quite small.

##  Reduce the Maximum Processor State

 This tip not only helped me reduce the power consumption of my laptop but also [fixed its heating issue](https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-trim-vlc-videos-on-mac-with-ease-no-quality-loss-guaranteed-for-2024/). So, when you reduce the Maximum processor state on your Windows laptop, you're actually limiting the maximum processing power that your CPU can use.

 Although you can reduce it to any number below 100, I would recommend you only reduce it by one percent to start, and decrease further from there if it turns out to be necessary. This way, you'll get a comparatively better battery life than before without compromising performance that much.

 To reduce the Maximum processor state, [open Command Prompt as an administrator](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-screen-mirroring-xiaomi-14-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-android/), type **powercfg /list** and hit Enter. Note down the Power Scheme GUID that appears in the output.

![Power list command in CMD.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/power-list-command-in-cmd-2.jpg) 

 Type **powercfg /DUPLICATESCHEME <Power Scheme GUID>** and hit Enter.

 Now, to see the new duplicate power scheme, type **powercfg /list** and hit Enter.

![Command to view duplicate power scheme in CMD.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/command-to-view-duplicate-power-scheme-in-cmd.jpg) 

 Type **powercfg /changename <Power Scheme GUID> "Customized Power Saving"** and hit Enter.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 To reduce CPU max clock speed of efficiency cores when laptop is not plugged into power, type **powercfg /setdcvalueindex <Power Scheme GUID> SUB\_PROCESSOR PROCTHROTTLEMAX 99** and hit Enter.

![Command for efficiency cores in CMD.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/command-for-efficiency-cores-in-cmd.jpg) 

 To reduce CPU max clock speed of performance cores when laptop is not plugged into power, type **powercfg /setdcvalueindex <Power Scheme GUID> SUB\_PROCESSOR PROCTHROTTLEMAX1 99** and hit Enter.

![Command for performance cores in CMD.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/command-for-performance-cores-in-cmd.jpg) 

 Next, type **powercfg /setactive <Power Scheme GUID>** and hit Enter.

![Setactive command in CMD](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/setactive-command-in-cmd.jpg) 

 After that, simply restart your computer and you will see a sudden increase in your battery performance and a reduction in laptop heat.

---

 These are all the working ways that can help you fix the battery drain issue of your laptop and improve its lifespan. However, if your laptop still continues to drain battery rapidly even after applying the tips above, it most likely means you need to replace your laptop battery. You should take your laptop to a technician to get it checked and have the battery replaced if necessary.
