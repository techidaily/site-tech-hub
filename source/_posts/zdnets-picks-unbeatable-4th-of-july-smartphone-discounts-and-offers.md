### When is Amazon Prime Day 2024?

Amazon Prime Day 2024 [officially ran](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-prime-day-2024-everything-you-need-to-know/) from July 16 at 12:01 a.m. PDT through July 17\. Competitors -- such as [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2F&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) and [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) \-- also ran their own version of the summer sale.

### Are Apple products really cheaper on Prime Day?

Apple rarely offers sales and discounts on its products, and considering the generally high price point, you might wait a while before upgrading your gear. So events such as Prime Day and Black Friday are great opportunities to save -- but discounts are often still low, with many deals we've observed offering roughly 5% to 20% off, at most. 

### Will iPads be on sale on Prime Day?

Yes. Even after Prime Day, there are many iPad deals still live. These tablets are popular and considering how many options are now on the market -- including iPad minis, the standard iPad, and iPad Pro models -- we can reliably expect discounts to appear each year.

### How did we choose these Prime Day deals?

ZDNET only recommends the devices we can stand behind, so when we say you're getting a good deal, we want to ensure your hard-earned money goes towards excellent value. To choose the top deals, we comb through the best sales available and make thorough price comparisons with historical data, combined with our personal experience with these products, to determine which ones are worth buying.

Our hope is to help you make the best choice to stretch your dollar.
