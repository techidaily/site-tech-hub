How to read pdf on kindle? If you are a Kindle fan, like me, you probably know that kindle devices support pdf files natively. However, if you directly transfer PDF to kindle, you may meet problems as below:

[Problem 1\.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)Some PDF documents Don't Look as Good. Some PDFs do not display properly, for example, the screen size is too big/small.

[Problem 2\.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)Some PDF eBooks Cannot Be Opened Because of DRM protection. Most eBooks purchased from ebook stores are encrypted.

To help you read pdf on kindle more smoothly, I will share some tips on how to read pdf on kindle.

Before I introduce the ultimate solution, let's first take a quick glance at some frequent problems we may encounter during the process of reading pdf files on kindle. This may help you get a better understanding. If you don't want to know this part, you can go straight to the final answer [How to Read PDFs on Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Read PDF on Kindle Issues: At a Glance

#### Problem 1\. Some PDF Documents Don't Look as Good

PDF is a file format that has captured all the elements of a printed document that you can view, navigate, print, or share with someone else without losing the original quality.

Just with this feature, reading a PDF on Kindle is not comfortable though Kindle does support PDF format. You cannot adjust the font size of the PDF document in a Kindle. Here I would like to take my Kindle Paperwhite as an example.

I connect my Kindle PaperWhite to computer, find the Kindle drive, then copy pdf documents from my computer to the "Documents" folder.

Then open the pdf document on my Kindle. You will find that not all PDFs can display properly. Most of PDF files are adapted to the print page size, but the screen of my kindle Paperwhite is much smaller. The pdf file's font is too small to view, especially for the images. Here I add a PDF file to my Kindle and just find the font size is too small to read.

See? Though kindle devives support reading personal pdf documents, the reading experience is too bad.

#### Problem 2\. Some PDF eBooks Cannot be Opened Because of DRM protection

The fact that Kindle devices only natively support ebooks purchased from Amazon Kindle store. So for PDF eBooks purchased from other ebook store like Kobo and Google Play, kindle devices can't open them because of the DRM protection. When you try to open a DRM-protected PDF ebook on your Kindle, you will see such a notice.

### How to Read PDF on Kindle

Don't worry this part I will show you how to read PDFs on kindle, including both personal PDF documents and purchased PDF ebooks.

**Tools you need:**

[Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html)  
[Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)\--the best eBook DRM Removal & eBook Converter

Step 1 **Collect PDFs in Adobe Digital Editions.**

No matter PDF documents or PDF ebooks, here I strongly recommend you collect them together in Adobe Digital Editions for better management (most purchased PDF ebooks are protected with Adobe DRM, which can only be opened with Adobe Digital Editions). If you don't have ADE on your computer yet, please first install it and authorize it with an Adobe ID. Then just add all your PDF files to ADE.

**Notices:** When adding personal pdf documents to ADE, if you see a pop-up window saying your pdf file is protected with password, you need to [remove password from PDF document](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) first.

Have you tried k2pdfopt? It can re-flow text even on scanned files and fit them to your e-reader screen.
